Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Every day, undocumented people trying to stay on the right path are filling 
out paperwork they know they need to lead their daily lives in this country. 
They have often lived in the community for many years, paying taxes and  
staying out of trouble. 
You probably have people like them in your community, you might know them 
well. Many are exactly the kind of person you would want as an American 
citizen, and in fact, lead lives valuing the same things that many other  
Americans value: faith, family, children, job security, safety in daily 
life, a supportive community.The commonality among all the diverse cases is that the 
prices of USCIS 
services is a hardship to pay for most hard-working families.  

In several examples around the world, insightful folks are realizing that 
the way out of poverty, and towards justice for all, is collective efforts 
focused on caring for people, not charging them. 
On behalf of myself and the many concerned citizens I have talked to that  
feel similarly, I urge you to consider a more permanent source of funding 
for USCIS than the very people driven here by necessity, now trying to become 
American.
