Re:  USCIS-2006-0044-0001 

I would like to protest the increase of fees for the adoption of children from outside the US.  I am 
an adoptive mother.  I adopted a child from China 12 years ago.  If I had to do it today, I 
couldn't afford to adopt.  The fees of the agency and the fees from The CCAA have not increased 
substantially.  However the fees to process I-600 have , as well as fees for Citizenship papers.  
Most of the people who adopt are not wealthy.  Most are stable middle class families who have a 
heart for orphans, and can and want to provide a home for them and build their families.  At the 
current time, many families adopting, from China especially, have to pay the I-600 fee two times, 
as the process is slow, taking anywhere from 18-24 months, and their I-600 has expired.  If you 
are going to increase the fee, then make it a one time only fee, valid until the adoption is 
completed. Paying an increased fee makes the cost just that much more expensive.  Many 
families in our local Chinese adoption group, are having yard sales and taking on extra jobs to be 
able to pay the adoption expenses.   

Please find another way to balance your budget.  Don't put the full burden on adoptive families. 
Thank you,
