Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 
The proposed rate increases should not be put into effect. The rates adoptive parents have to pay 
for international adoptions are already extremely high and sometimes must be paid twice due to 
delays in the process and expired paperwork. Paying $600 dollars once for a piece of paper 
allowing a couple to bring a child into the country as their own is a little steep. Paying it a second 
time to get the exact same piece of paper just with a new date on it because of bureaucratic 
delays and expired paperwork is totally ridiculous. Raising these fees just adds to the already 
overwhelming amount of money people spend to rescue these children. Also, paying $140 dollars 
for a couple to get fingerprinted is high, but raising it even by ten dollars is one more expense 
they donâ€™t need. Paying $160 dollars once to prove that you are not a criminal is bad, but again 
they are faced with having to pay it twice because of too short expiration periods. That also is 
ridiculous because I wonder how many people have fingerprints that change in 18 months. Why 
not rerun the fingerprints for free? They already have them in the system. Well, we all know that 
the government wants to make money off of everything, but why squeeze it out of those that are 
already spending tens of thousands unselfishly for the rescuing of one child? I sincerely hope that 
the government decides to do the right thing this time. 

Sincerely,
