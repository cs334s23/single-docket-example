Subject: unless the waiting time and depth of the backgorund checks are less. 

unless the waiting time and depth of the backgorund checks are less. 
please note that a fee increase will delay the immigrants aspiring to obtain citizenship a 
lot more dificult. 
the prices that you have estimated are ridiculous for someone like me to pay for, and will 
never be able to pay. 
please also note that the fees will not allow someone like me in my income bracket to pay 
for this and help my 
wife become a tax paying citizen, though the government still taxes us on this. 

please reconsider your position.
