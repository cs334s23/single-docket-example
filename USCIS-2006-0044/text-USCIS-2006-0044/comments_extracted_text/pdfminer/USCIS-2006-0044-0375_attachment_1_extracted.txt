Subject: Naturalization Fee Increase 

Dear Sir: 

What are the related fees that would be included in the naturalization 
proposed fee increase? 
We only know of one extra fee "biometrics." 

The $400.00 fee (including biometrics) is already  high for people which 
makes $6.50/hr. 

An increase in naturalization fees will make it more difficult for an 
applicant of low 
wages to apply. 

I think that only people with extra money will be able to naturalize. 

Have a lovely day.
