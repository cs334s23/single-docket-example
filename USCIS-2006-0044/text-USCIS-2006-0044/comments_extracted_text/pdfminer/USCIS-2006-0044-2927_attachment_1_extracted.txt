Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS- 2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am absolutely amazed that yet another proposed increase is being addressed.  Having 
been in the international adoption community for over 7 years now, I have already seen 
way too many increases without an increase in the level of service or time that families 
are helped. 

Adoption is expensive enough already, and it is unconscionable to raise fees by up to 
66% for adoption-related petitions.  Especially when processing times are taking longer 
and the service level provided by local USCIS offices has greatly declined.  It is almost a 
joke within the adoption community when someone is actually needed to answer a phone 
at a USCIS office as it is virtually impossible to get in touch with anyone and, when you 
do, just as hard to get anyone to answer the call or return one.    Another thing to mention 
is that as foreign countries take longer to complete adoptions, many families have to 
completely redo their I600A petitions, with fingreprints, so they are hit twice as hard.  It 
just seems like "price gouging", for lack of a better term, in my eyes.  And, trust me, the 
families involved feel that way as well. 

I honestly have very little faith that the complaints and concerns of a few individuals will 
make any difference at all within our federal government but felt compelled to at least 
share how bothered I am by this proposal.   

Most sincerely,

Our children are not ours because they share our genes... 
they are ours because we have had the audacity to envision them.  
That, at the end of the day...or long sleepless night,  
is how love really works.
