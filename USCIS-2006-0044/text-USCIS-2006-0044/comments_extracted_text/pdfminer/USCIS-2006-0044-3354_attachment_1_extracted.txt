Subject: Petitions against proposed USCIS Filing Fees Increase 

Dear Dr. Gonzalez: 

Attached, please find petitions signed by immigrants, family members, 
and friends against the proposed steep filing fee increases.  The 
wording of the petitions is as follows: 

"As immigrants applying for citizenship at the statewide Citizenship 
Day workshops organized in Washington State on March 24th 2007, 
and their families and friends, we are writing to oppose the proposed 
steep fee increases for immigration (DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-
0044), especially the fees to reunite family members, to apply for a 
green card and for citizenship.  These fees are especially difficult for 
those of us working at minimum wages and those of us with large 
families." 

"We are afraid these fees will prevent or delay many legal immigrants 
in our community from achieving the American dream of U.S. 
citizenship." 

"The American government should welcome hardworking, patriotic 
immigrants like us who want to be part of the United States, not put 
barriers in our way.  Keep the door to the American Dream open to 
those of us who want to pursue it." 

"Thank you for your favorable consideration." 

Please think seriously about the impact the fee increases will have on 
these hardworking people who contribute so much to our country. 

Sincerely, 

Janet Gwilym
