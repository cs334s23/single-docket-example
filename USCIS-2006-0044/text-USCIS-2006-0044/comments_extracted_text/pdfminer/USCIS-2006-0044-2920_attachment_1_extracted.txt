Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

In regards to docket no. USCIS-2006-0044, I just want to say that for a lot of adopting parents, 
including myself, coming up with 
extra money is very difficult. We have to cut back on expenses because international adoption is 
outrageously expensive. 

I urge you not to raise the fees at this time. There are just too many of us who need a break, 
somewhere. 

Thank you for your time, 

Donna Ardito
