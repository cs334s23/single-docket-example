I understand that a lot of research on cost of doing business has been done, and a lot of thought 
put into this, but these prices are completely out of reach for a large percentage of the 
population.  I have been thanking God myself that my immigration expense paying is close to out 
of the way! 

I am US citizen...I have a Master's degree and teach in our public schools.  Next month, I have to 
pay to file a Waiver of Excludability for my husband to come into the country.  If I was filing it 
under the new fees, there is no way I would be able to afford it!  If someone with a "good" job, 
and an education finds these new prices out of reach, what happens to those who are 
immigrating here to get their chance?  What happens to those who do not have an education or a 
"good" job?!   

The money has to come from somewhere else, namely Congress.  This is a matter of national 
security, and therefore, the fees are being used to pay for security, a matter that should be 
supplemented with taxes. 

As a school teacher, I know that funding is hard to come by, but I also know the desperation of 
needing a family member to be in your country with you, and not having the money to do 
ANYTHING about it.  These prices are out of this world and too high for the ones who will need to 
pay them.
