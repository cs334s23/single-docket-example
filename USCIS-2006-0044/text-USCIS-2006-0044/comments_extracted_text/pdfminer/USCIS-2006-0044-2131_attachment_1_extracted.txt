I am writing to express my strong disapproval of the planned immigration fee increases. 
Nobody can complain about steady, perhaps annual increases, but such enormous 
increases are not fair on those people, like myself, who are currrently in the process of 
applying for permanent status (just filed I-140). Clearly, if the proposed increases go 
ahead, I will face a large bill to complete the process. However, I do not see how I will 
personally benefit from any improvements to the system since these will take some time 
to implement, i.e. I suspect I will be waiting just as long to complete the process as I 
would if the fees do not increase. 
It seems to me that a step-wise increase in the fees would be fairer to all. Alternatively, 
an initial investment could be made to improve the sytem. Once it is proven that this does 
indeed lead to a reduction in the backlog of applications, a fee incease to cover costs 
would then seem reasonable (but not before!) 
In summary, I believe that, in its current form, the proposal for fee increases is extremely 
unjust. I urge you to consider other, more equitable, options.
