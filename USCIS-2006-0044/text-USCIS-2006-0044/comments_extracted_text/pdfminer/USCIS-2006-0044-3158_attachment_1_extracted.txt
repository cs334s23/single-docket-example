Subject: Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service 

Re: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, CIS No. 2393-06; Docket No. USCIS-
2006-0044, RIN 1615-AB53  

To whom it may concern:  

I am opposed to the increase in USCIS fees that this proposed rule would permit the 
agency to charge as they apply to international adoption. When the process to adopt is 
already expensive and excludes many loving, caring families from adopting orphans, why 
would anyone make it even MORE difficult? The "wealth" of a home is measured in love 
- not dollars. I was fortunate to have the resources to complete an international adoption. 
However, many of my friends are not. They would make wonderful, loving parents to a 
child who currently has no one.  

I support an exemption from the increased fees for everything USCIS does related to 
international adoption.  

Thank you for considering these comments.
