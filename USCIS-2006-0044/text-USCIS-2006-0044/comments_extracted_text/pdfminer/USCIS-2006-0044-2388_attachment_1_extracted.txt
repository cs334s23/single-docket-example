Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

We have been waiting for almost nine months to adopt a baby girl from China. It 
is likely that our paperwork will expire prior to our travel, thus requiring re-
application and additional fees. We understand that fees need to be adequate to 
cover government expenses at a reasonable level. We hope that you will keep in 
mind that we are just ordinary citizens who wish to enlarge our family through 
adoption of a child who would not otherwise have the opportunity. We would 
appreciate the fees being kept as low as possible to enable us, and others like 
us, to achieve our dream, without undue financial burden. 

Thank you, 

Sincerely, 

Linda & Eric Groat
