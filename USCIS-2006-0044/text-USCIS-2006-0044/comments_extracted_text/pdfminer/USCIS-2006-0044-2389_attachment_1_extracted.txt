Subject: USCIS 2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I would like to express my concern over the proposed rule, 2006-004, which would increase the 
Immigration Examinations Fee. As a family who has adopted and baby girl from China, and is in 
the process of adopting again, the increase in fees comes as a blow. There is now a wait in China 
of 17 months to even get a referral so we will have to renew some of our USCIS info. The cost of 
international adoption  is already high, and now our country proposes to incur more fees. 

For abandoned children all over the world and the people who want to provide loving homes for 
them, please reconsider your price increase.  

Thank you,
