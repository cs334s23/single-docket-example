Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

While illegal aliens flood our borders and consume our tax money in the form of medical 
care, school costs, and legal expenses - it is appalling our government is going to levy up 
to a %66 increase of fees against a group of tax-paying, American citizens who are 
already facing huge costs and for what.... to salvage a life. While we work two and three 
jobs to meet these financial demands, you raise the hurdle even higher. Add to this, the 
fact we are paying for something that will expire before we can even use it because of 
USCIS time limits, many of us will face having to pay this fee twice due to lengthen 
referral times!!! Why have I been paying taxes for the last 35 years to a government who 
takes advantage of an 'easy mark'?!  I guess you figured it out- most of us would do 
anything to finally hold the child in our arms that was born in our hearts.
