Subject: USCIS- 2006-0044 

Dear Director, Regulatory Management Division, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services, Department of Homeland Security, 

My name is Alexis Akagawa and I am the International Student Advisor/Program 
Coordinator at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in Minnesota. 

In 1998, our students paid $70 to file the form I-765 with USCIS. In 1999 they paid $100, 
the years 2000 and 2002 $120. Examples of the proposed fees include: OPT (I-765) 
current: $180, proposed new fee: $340. Change of status (I-539) current: $200, proposed 
new fee: $300. Replace lost I-94 (I-102) current: $160, proposed new fee: $320. 

This is very upsetting because in the 2004/2005 academic year there 
were 8,491 international students in Minnesota. According to iie.org they 
spent $172,057,746 in tuition, fees and living expenditures for themselves and their 
dependents. Our students must creating solid portfolios, take English language tests, jump 
through many academic and financial hoops and leave their families in their home 
countries in order to contribute to the U.S. industry and economy. At MCAD they are 
full-tuition paying and must meet the Financial Certification amount of $36,214 and 
receive no need-based scholarships. For my small school of 600 Bachelor of Fine Arts 
candidates this equals a contribution of approximately $350,000 to our institution and 
local community.  

By raising fees, it looks like the U.S. is not a welcoming place for international students. 
Many students feel that they are getting 'nickeled and dimed". They bring so much money 
to our country as is that asking them to pay more for necessary processing forms seems 
short-sighted. 

I fear that in return the U.S. will see retaliation fee hikes for our off campus studies 
students like the one announced last week. "Fee Hike for International Students in 
Singapore. Singapore's Ministry of Education is planning to increase fees paid by 
international students." http://www.business-
standard.com/common/storypage.php?autono=273244&leftnm=6&subLeft=0&chkFlg A
nd why shouldn't they? The country of Ireland just changed its policy so that a student 
registration with the police costs 100 euro. Just last year our spring 2006 study abroad 
participants paid nothing. It is hard enough to encourage U.S. students to forfeit their 
work study money, sub-lease their apartment, save money for today's exchange rate of $1 
to .52 United Kingdom Pounds and apply for student visas. Although strong-willed 
students will always find a way to a global experience, added fees do not help my 
recruiting efforts. 

Please do not dramatically increase your fees this year. 

Thank you. 
Alexis Akagawa
