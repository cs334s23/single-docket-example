Subject: Proposed immigration fees 

This letter is to offer my comments on the proposed USCIS increase in fees for various 
immigration applications, especially the proposed increase to apply for naturalization and for 
permanent residency. 

I believe that these proposed increases are quite excessive and unfair to immigrants.  They 
border on the ridiculous.  A 70% increase in the cost of applying for citizenship is drastic and a 
huge burden for permanent residents who have been waiting to apply for naturalization. 

The proposed increase to $905 for applying for permanent residence is outrageous and 
shocking.  It leads me to believe that there is a political reason for this increase. 

Instead, the USCIS should ask Congress for funding for their financial needs, not burden our 
immigrants.  I have worked with new immigrants throughout my career of 27 years and know 
that immigrants do not deserve this obstruction on their road to becoming American citizens.
