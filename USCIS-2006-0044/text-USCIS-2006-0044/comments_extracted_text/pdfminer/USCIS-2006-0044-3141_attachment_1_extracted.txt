Subject: Fee increases 

Agency name -U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
Docket number - USCIS-2006-0044   

To whom it may concern: 

My wife and I have reviewed the proposed increase in fees for the USCIS involving 
international adoption.  I can say that from a financial standpoint this will only be a further 
burden to families trying to give a child a home.   

Also, I don't mind increased costs if there was a guarantee of improved service, but I am 
not expecting this.  We can honestly say that the USCIS was directly responsible for 
delaying our adoption paperwork for months.  From talking with many other families, this is 
a very common trend.  A simple phone call from your office to solve a straightforward issue 
would have saved us significant heartache and stress.  Trying to call USCIS is nearly 
worthless also, transfer upon transfer with each person trying to find a way to pawn us off 
on someone else.   

Lastly, we receive this somewhat threatening letter about our fingerprinting telling us 
exactly when and where to be within less than a week's notice.  The document goes on about 
how we can't bring electronic devices and have to arrive at the specified time or our 
documents would be considered abandoned.  We completely changed our schedule, arrived on 
time to wait an hour and half with a room full of people playing on their cell phones and 
ipods. 

So, now the USCIS is asking for more money?  I am offended and insulted by such 
inefficiency and lack of caring by my own's government agency.  Unless the USCIS can 
absolutely guarantee in writing that wait times will be improved and U.S. citizens will 
actually be treated like citizens, then I see no need to pay more money for their poor 
services. 

Yours truly, 

Casey and Jenifer Fowler
