 Director, Regulatory Management Division: 

As an attorney practicing in the field of immigration law, I have 
significant experience with the immigration process.   I am appalled by 
the Service's proposal to radically increase its fees.  

I would like to highlight the increased adjustment of status fee (to 
$905), with the rationale that it includes one I-765 and I-131.  I think 
this is disingenuous and perhaps based on misinformation.  In my years of 
practice, it is the rarer client who requests both a I-765 and/or I-131.  
Many times, my clients were already in a valid dual-intent non-immigrant 
status, and did not need nor want the I-765 and I-131.  More frequently, 
especially those 245(i) eligible clients, they would not qualify for I-131 
as the 3/10 year bar would attach.  Therefore, in effect, for many people, 
the increase from $395 to $905 is astronomical and unfair because they do 
obtain the supposed added benefits of an I-765 and I-131.  I would suggest 
you reconsider this and the other rates of increase on applications. 

Sincerely,
