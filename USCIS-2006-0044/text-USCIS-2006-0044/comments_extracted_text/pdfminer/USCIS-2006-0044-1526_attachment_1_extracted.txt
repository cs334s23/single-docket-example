As you will no doubt be inundated with messages from immigration lawyers, service providers 
and their clients protesting the proposed fee increases, I thought you ought to have at least one 
that congratulates you for complying with your Congressional mandate to set service fees at a 
level sufficient to cover the costs of providing those services. The services you are providing are 
primarily for the immigrant community, not the general American public. It is, therefore, not 
appropriate to be expending public funds on providing those services. To the extent that some 
U.S. citizens or permanent residents may benefit from those services, i.e., employers or relatives, 
they personally should accept responsibility for paying for or contributing to the payment of those 
service costs. 
At the same time, I believe that you have the responsibility to assure the service-recipient 
population that you are not setting fees unnecessarily high to cover inefficiency or to build a nest 
egg to defray future costs such as an amnesty for illegal aliens.
