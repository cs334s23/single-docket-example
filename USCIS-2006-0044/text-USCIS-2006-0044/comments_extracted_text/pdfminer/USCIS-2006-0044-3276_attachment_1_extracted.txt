I want to comment on the proposed increases in fees for the following applications: 

Green card, work permit, naturalization, and travel documents 

I am opposed to these increases as they will make it harder for low-income immigrants to 
be able to afford the fees for the programs that offer needed benefits, such as the work 
permit.   

Also, to increase these fees so drastically in such a short period of time in comparision to 
other fee increases that have been done incrementallys seems to be wrong. 

I would appreciate your consideration of not raising the fees as proposed. 

 Thanks.
