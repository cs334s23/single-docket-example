USCIS Proposed Fee Increase on Naturalization Fees 

Dear Sir/Madam: 

The proposed increases hurt low-income and middle income families and individuals. Many legal 
permanent residents, like my wife Natalie, are eager to become naturalized but instead of 
encouraging them and providing an incentive, this proposed legislation does the opposite. 

I urge you reconsider this and keep the fees where they are now, or even better, reduce the fees 
and facilitate the naturalization process further for all the many permanent residents eager to 
called themselves U.S. citizens. 

Thank you for your attention. 

Best regards,
