Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

Regarding the proposed USCIS rule change to increase fees for certain visa 
applications (USCIS-2006-0044). 

The proposed fees should be at least 50 times as much ($25,000 to $35,000) 
in order to cover reasonable costs for prudent background investigations of 
visa applicants. 

The applicant and family members, employers, professors and/or teachers, 
landlords, and neighbors should all be interviewed to cross-check 
information on the application and to determine the individual's likelihood 
to initiate force or fraud.
