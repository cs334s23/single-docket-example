To Whom It May Concern, 

   I am concerned with the proposed immigration fee increases. The increases would 
make it difficult, if not impossible for people who aren't of financial wealth to enter into 
the United States . I don't think that it is fair to raise the fees to such an unreasonable 
amount. How can we expect immigrants to come here legally, and then make it nearly 
impossible for them to afford it? It's just unreasonable. 

    Thank you for your attention.
