To whom it may concern, 

I urge you to keep fees for immigration petitions and biometric services at their current levels.  My 
husband and I are in the very long process of adopting internationally.  Not only is this process is 
difficult and costly, but due to increasing wait times, we will have to apply for our child's I-600 
twice, as the first one will expire before we can travel.  USCIS fee increases signficantly affect 
adoptive families.  Please consider us and our concerns and refrain from increasing the fees. 

Sincerely, 

Susan Fule
