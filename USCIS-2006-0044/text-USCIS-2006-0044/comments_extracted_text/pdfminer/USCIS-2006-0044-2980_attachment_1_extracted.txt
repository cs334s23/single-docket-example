Subject: Agains USCIS increases 

Dear USCIS, 

I, Dan Singer, am deeply opposed to the proposed increase in the application 
fee for U.S. citizenship and other immigration benefits because it adversly 
affects this already financially vulnerable population. It also sends the 
wrong, unwelcoming, message to them. Please reconsider doing this.
