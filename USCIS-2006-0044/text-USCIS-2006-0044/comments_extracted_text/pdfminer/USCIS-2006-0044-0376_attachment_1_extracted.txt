Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear Sir: 

During the last four years, I have dealt with INS and am currently dealing with USCIS.  The last two 
increases did absolutely nothing to increase USCIS efficiency and reliability.  As well as milking 
applicants for higher fees, the USCIS inefficiency has provided a built in cash cow, as applicants have 
to pay for multiple work authorization and advance parole applications at increased fees.  The 
inefficiency of processing these applications result in WO and AP for less than a year, resulting in yet 
more money spent. 

USCIS HAS NOT met the President's requirements, as they "cook the books" as to their 
accomplishments.  If an application is pending, it is part of the backlog, regardless of reason. 

Without beating this to death, the US Government should be ashamed of USCIS.  It is by far the least 
efficient, least organized, and by far the most antiquated from a technology standpoint, of any 
govermenet agency.
