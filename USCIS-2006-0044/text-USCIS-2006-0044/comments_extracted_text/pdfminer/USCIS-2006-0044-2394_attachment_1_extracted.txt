To whom it may concern, 
I am writing in regard to the proposal to raise fees and how this will 
affect prospective adoptive parents. 
My husband and I are currently in the beginning stages of adoption and 
are trying to plan financially. As you may well be aware, adoption is 
extremely expensive. 
All we want is a family without suffering financially more than is 
necessary with this process. Please consider the people who will be 
affected by this.  We have already been punished by infertility. As 
wonderful as adoption is, for many even the slightest amount can make 
or break them. Please don't raise these fees. 

Thank you.
