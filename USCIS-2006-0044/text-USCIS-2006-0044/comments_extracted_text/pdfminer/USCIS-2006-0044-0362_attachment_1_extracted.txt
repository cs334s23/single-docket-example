We all know money is an issue, by if u raise the fees u will allow the rich to enter this 
country as usual. The under priverlidged will be left aside and that is not what this 
country is all about. So as the cost rise think of who u are pushing aside. Money dosen't 
make the person quality just rich! 
    With this country in mind'
