Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on proposed fee changes for adoption-related 
services.  I would like for the agency to consider the adverse impact that such drastic fee 
increases will have on potential adoptions.  One of the most significant factors that potential 
adoptive parents must consider is the financial cost of such an endeavor.  Increases in agency 
fees as significant as these, as high as 66%, will discourage these couples, possibly to the extent 
that they will discontinue pursuing their dream of adopting a child.   Since there are so many 
children, both in the US and around the world, who need a "forever family," the US government 
needs to do all that it can to support instead of discourage potential adoptive parents. 

Thanks again for considering this comment.
