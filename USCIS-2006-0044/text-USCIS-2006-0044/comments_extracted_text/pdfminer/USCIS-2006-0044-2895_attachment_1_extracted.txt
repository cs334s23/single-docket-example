Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am writing to express my dismay over the proposed fee increases for the 
following adoption-related petitions (I-600, I-600A, N-600, N-565 and Biometric 
Services). 

These large fee increases will only add more financial stress to those who adopt 
children internationally. 

Our adopted son came home to us in 2003 ** as a U.S. Citizen **, as he entered 
the country on an IR-3 Visa. He has his social security number and a US 
Passport. However, in order to receive his citizenship, we are expected to file the 
N-600 and pay the fee. This in itself is terribly unfair. He is a U.S. citizen by law. 
Why do we have to apply for his citizenship as though he is NOT? I can tell you 
that finding an extra $255.00 to apply for his COC has not been possible to this 
point, and finding an extra $460.00 will likely be impossible for us. 

I urge you to reconsider these large fee increases.
