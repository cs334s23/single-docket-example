Dear Director Regulatory Management Commission: 

April 2, 2007

RE:   DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 
Proposed rule ï¿½ Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit 
Application and Petition Fee Schedule 

To Whom it May Concern: 

I write to strongly oppose the increase of immigration and naturalization 
fees that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) proposed 
on February 1, 2007.  Every day immigrants and refugees already struggle 
to pay immigration fees.  The steep increases proposed by USCIS would make 
it much more difficult to gain permanent resident status, reunite with 
family members, and become a U.S. citizen.  USCIS should be helping 
immigrants become citizens, not making it harder. 

I am a teacher and I have several students who are constantly worried 
about their parents' immigration status. The United States government 
should do as much possible to make it easier for people to become 
citizens. 

USCIS claims that the fee increase is necessary to improve service, and 
USCIS definitely needs to improve service.  While I applaud USCIS's 
efforts to improve service, I do not think that the entire cost should 
rest on immigrants who are already paying taxes, working hard, and 
struggling to pay high fees while receiving poor service.  

Immigration and citizenship are public goods that benefit our entire 
country and that we as a nation should help pay for.  Immigrants work 
hard, pay taxes, and help revitalize our communities.  In becoming 
citizens, immigrants demonstrate their strong commitment to their new home 
country by learning English, gaining knowledge about American history and 
government, and swearing allegiance to the United States.  We should be 
encouraging immigrants to become part of our community by gaining legal 
status and becoming citizens, not setting up barriers that block their 
path and keep them out.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For all these reasons, I strongly oppose the proposed fee increases and 
urge USCIS to reconsider this proposal, and to seek other sources of 
funding for its operations, rather than add more burdens on immigrants.  
Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Adriana Chavira
