Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 ( Immigration Cost Increases) 

    I am concerned that by raising fees so drastically for immigrants that all you will be doing is 
encouraging more illegal immigration. At the present time immigrants trying to come to our 
country legally have trouble coming up with the money to cover the costs so increases are totally 
out of line. You folks need to be streamlining the immigration process rather than creating 
stumbling blocks. USCIS states that additional money is needed to improve the process, but I 
have been around long enough (66 years) to know that no Government agency is ever self 
supporting. Therefore, you just need to request more of our tax money that is being wasted on 
Congressional "pet projects" in order to improve the immigration system. The bottom line is, if you 
increase immigration costs you are becoming part of the problem rather than solving the problem.
