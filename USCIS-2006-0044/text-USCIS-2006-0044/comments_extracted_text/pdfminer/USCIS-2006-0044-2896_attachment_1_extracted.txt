Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 Comment!

Dear Madam or Sir: 

I am writing in reference to  the U. S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services proposed increase in filing 
fees for adoption-related forms and Certificates of Citizenship (docket number: USCIS-2006-0044). 

Considering the immense cost that adoption already incurs for families opening their hearts and homes in 
this great country, it would be a terrible shame that the USCIS again (since 2004) add to the strained 
resources of these families. 

IF there had to be an increase, could it not be at a lower percentage? 

Thank you.
