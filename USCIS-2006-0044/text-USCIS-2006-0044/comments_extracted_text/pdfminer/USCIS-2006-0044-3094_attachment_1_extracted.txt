Re: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044  

I am writing to comment on the proposed fee increases of the USCIS applications and 
petitions.  
.  
As a volunteer at a Refugee Rights office, I work every day with clients whose futures 
will be severely and negatively affected by these fee increases. Although I understand the 
need for fees to go up to account for the cost of living increases, I don't understand why 
you would propose such drastic increases.  

For the application for Permanent Residency (I-485) to go from $325 to $905 truly seems 
particularly punitive. The vast majority of our clients who are applying for their 
Permanent Residency are people who have won political asylum and have only been here 
in this country a year or two, after suffering unimaginable hardships, including torture 
and every kind of repression, in their own countries. They have struggled just to get here 
alive, and then have had to fight hard to win the right to stay here. Most of them do not 
yet have good jobs or English language fluency. It would be impossible for most of them 
to apply for their Permanent Residency if they have to pay this new exorbitant amount. 
The result will be that they will not apply for their Permanent Residency, and so never 
have the opportunities which that status would afford them. It will severely restrict their 
futures in this country, and hamper their abilities to lead full lives here, contributing fully 
to our society.  

Please reconsider this proposed fee increase!!  

A reasonable increase would be understandable, but this proposed increase seems 
inhuman and punitive, to a segment of the population which is already struggling to have 
a future here.  

I'm hoping these changes will be modified to be more just and humane.
