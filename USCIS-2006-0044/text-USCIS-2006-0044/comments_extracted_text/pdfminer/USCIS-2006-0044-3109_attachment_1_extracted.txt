Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

 The increase is too drastic and would keep many legal permanent 
residents from pursuing citizenship.  From one side the government is 
telling us that we should follow the rules and fix our situation and on 
the other hand the same government is putting hurdles for us to fulfill 
the requirements.  I agree that fee increases are necessary to keep up 
to the cost of living. Moderate increase would be acceptable.
