Subject: Citizenship Fee Increase DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear Director, 

     I am a citizenship teacher at Chicago Uptown Chinese Mutual Aid Association. 

     My students and I have a suggestion regarding the N400 application fee.  First, we understand 
that CIS needs to collect fees to process applications.  However, we, the applicants who are low 
income families and want to become US citizens, consider 
that it is a privilege to become a US citizen. (I believe that it is my privilege to teach them 
citizenship.) 

     Therefore, we propose setting the minimum application fee at $400.00 and have the fee vary 
according to each applicant's earnings, which appear on his/her latest 1040 income tax return, 
based on page 1, line 37.  If he/she makes $50,000 or more, the fee would be $500.00; $60,000 
or more, the fee would be $600.00; up to $100,000 or more would pay $1,000.00 which is the 
maximum.  Each applicant should attach the copy of the most recent 1040 with N400 application. 

     America is the land of opportunity.  Some new immigrants really make their fortune in 
America.  To share their fortune with the less fortunate so they can become US citizens is  a good 
way to learn American values. 

     My undersigned students and I propose this approach to collect the N400 application fee. 

Respectfully yours, 

Daisy Liu
