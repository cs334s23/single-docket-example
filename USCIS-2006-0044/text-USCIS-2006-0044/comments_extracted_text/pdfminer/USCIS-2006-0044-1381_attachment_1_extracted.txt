To Whom it may concern: 

I would like to comment on the proposed fee for the I600A as I have filed this form twice as I have 
already adopted from China once and currently in the process to adopt a second time.   

I see the proposed fee is scheduled to increase from 545 to 670 with 125 dollar increase.  My 
concern is that the I171H issued once you are approved is only good for 18 months following the 
approval.  Currently the China wait to adopt a foreign child is 16 months and may increase in the 
future.  This means most people waiting for their referrals will have to get an updated I171 before 
they even travel to get their child.  In addition, the fingerprints are only good for 15 months and 
then have to be re-done as well. 

If the fees need to be raised, it would make sense to at least increase the length of time the 
I171H is good for, maybe 2 years instead of 18 months so that I will be able to get my child back 
here without having to file for another I600A and another fee.  It just doesn't seem fair that I will 
most likely have to pay this fee twice because of the length of time the approval is good for.  As it 
is, I am sure I will have to get my fingerprints re-done as well which is also an additional fee. 

It also seems to make sense to increase the length of time the finger prints are good for.  Why 
have an approval form (I171H) good for 18 months but the fingerprints only good for 15.  This 
makes no sense. 

It also seems reasonable that if you make the 171H approval good for 2 years rather than 18 
months you will also have less of a work load.   Just a thought as speaking from experience, 
adoption is not cheap and I really don't want to have to pay this fee twice especially with an 
increase in the cost of this form. 

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 
Elizabeth L. Montcalm
