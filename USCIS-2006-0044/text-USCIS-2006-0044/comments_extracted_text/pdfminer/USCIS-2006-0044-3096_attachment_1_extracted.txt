DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044
Document Title: Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition 
Fee Schedule 

We are sending this e-mail to express our deep concern for the USCIS proposed plan for adjustment of the 
immigration and naturalization benefit application and petition fee schedule. Our concern is specifically for 
the fees that will be increased that relate to international adoption. We adopted a child internationally two 
years ago and would like to do so again, but the proposed rate increase of almost 66% will make it very 
difficult, if not impossible, for many families to adopt. Because many countries are taking longer 
to complete the adoption than the fingerprints and 171-H are valid, we must have these 
renued, which causes us to have to pay the fees twice. It is already difficult for families to 
pay for these fees twice, but with the proposed increases many families may no longer be 
able to afford to adopt, and many children around the world may never find a forever 
home. A home is something that every child deserves to have. We ask you to please 
reconsider raising these fees.
