I have read excerpts of this proposed legislation, and although I am certain I do not 
understand all that is involved in this department, I would ask you to be much more 
conservative in your rates/fees increases.  We in America are all used to continual price 
increases in every area, but never to the tune of 250%!  I am a middle class citizen here in 
the USA and would find it very difficult to appropriate most of the proposed fees, much 
less someone who is very poor from an underpriveleged country. 
Maybe if we make immigration easier, faster and more affordable, there wouldnt be such 
a huge illegal problem as is currently present.  And please dont punish the ones of us who 
are attempting to abide by the laws, by increasing rates to pay for the services afforded 
freely to those who have not paid anything at all!  My bottom line is.....please consider a 
reasonable price increase, say 10-20%, and try to find ways to increase efficiency ~ thats 
what we all have to do to run a business and stay competitive, otherwise we price 
ourselves out of the market place.  We dont mind paying - we just dont want to feel like 
we are being raped.  Surely, you can do better.....for those who dream of living in this 
wonderful country as we freely do. 
Thank you. 

Sincerely,
