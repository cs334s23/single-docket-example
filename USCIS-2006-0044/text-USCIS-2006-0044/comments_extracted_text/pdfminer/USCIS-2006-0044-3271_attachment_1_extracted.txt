Subject: Docket ID USCIS-2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern, 

I am writing to you in regards to the above referenced "Adjustment of 
the Immigration Benefit Application/Petition and Biometric Fee 
Schedule" also known as Docket ID USCIS-2006-0044. 

For those of us who are looking to adopt our children, this increase 
in fees is not only distressing, but also disheartening.  The cost of 
domestic and international adoption runs well into the thousands of 
dollars and most families already have to scrimp and save to be able 
to afford it.  Some even refinance their homes and take out loans to 
bring their child home. 

Simply put, adoption is expensive enough already and it is 
unconscionable to raise fees by up to 66% for adoption-related 
petitions.  Please listen to the heart of this mother and don't make 
it any harder for children to find their forever families. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, 

Michelle Austin
