Dear Mr. Gonzalez,  

If this plan is to simply reduce the number of prospect immigrants to the US, it will be a 
success. However, by the proposed plan, it will significantly give significant financial 
burden on us. I am currently working as E-2 holder worker due to inefficient process by 
the Department of Labor. My previous H-1B visa was expired in December of 2006 
while my employer supported applying for an employer based green card. However, I 
have been waiting for the appeal for denial of Labor Certificate which submitted in April 
2006, and after waiting for almost 10 months, nothing has processed.  

Even if the fee increases, it will not be the solution. I believe it is a system-wide 
dysfunction.  

Not only increasing the fee, US Homeland Security prohibited processing I-130 outside 
US. This is a significant impact to a significant numbers of couples who got married in 
oversea. Some who already in their country, but due to the immediate change, their 
paperwork was overturned, and they have no clue what to do. Also, this will prohibit 
people who want to get married in other countries, however, a spouse will not be able to 
enter the US as US prohibits a spouse to enter as a tourist visa. Some couples are apart 
due to the change.  

In addition, as a foreign worker, I have been paying taxes, however, as my status 
prohibits, I will never receive the benefits that all other Americans will receive when I 
equally pay taxes as Americans do.  

If the delay will never occur during the process and if this is guaranteed, it may worth a 
consideration, however, with this already-dysfunction system, I do not believe any 
positive change will happen, this will simply aggrevate increase of attoney fees.  

Sincerely, 

Yoko Nishikubo
