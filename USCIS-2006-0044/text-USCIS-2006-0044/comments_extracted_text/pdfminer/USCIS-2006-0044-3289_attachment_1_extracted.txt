I would like to comment on the proposed USCIS fee increases for petitions related to international 
adoption.  These include the I-600/600A (Petition to Classify and Orphan as an Immediate 
Relative), N-565 (Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship), N-600 (Application for 
Certificate of Citizenship), Biometric Services (fingerprinting), and the I-824 (Request for Action 
on Approved Petition). 

As I'm sure you're aware, international adoption has become a very expensive undertaking.  It is 
not unusual for a family to spend anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 (depending on the 
country of origin) to bring a single child home.  As costs continue to rise, many families who 
would like to adopt an orphaned child are finding that they simply cannot afford to do so.  The 
USCIS fee increases would only add to the financial burden and the losers would ultimately be 
orphaned children.  The current USCIS fees are not insignificant and some of the proposed 
increases are quite substantial.  As it stands, the expiration date on the I-600/600A form is such 
that many families are unable to complete the adoption process in the alotted time frame and 
must resubmit all of the paperwork a second time in order to bring their child home.  This means 
that families must pay for fingerprinting and the submission of the I-600/600A a second time!  I 
am currently in the process of adopting a child from China and am facing this situation right now.  
I might also add that customer service at the USCIS has been less than stellar!  It can take 2 - 3 
months to receive an I-171H and trying to get information on the status of your application is very 
difficult. 

As a nation, we should be doing all that we can to support needy children.  We should be doing 
everything we can to support and encourage families who are trying to adopt children rather than 
increasing the financial burden.  I ask you to reconsider the USCIS fee increases. 

Sincerely, 

Joy Kairies
