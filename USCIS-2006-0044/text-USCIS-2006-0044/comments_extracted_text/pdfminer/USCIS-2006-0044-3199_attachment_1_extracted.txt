Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Dear Director, Management Division of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: 

At the end of 2005, my husband and I decided to start the process of adopting a child 
from China.  Our paper work arrived in China in July 2006.  Up to that point, we had 
spent a good portion of money allocated to the adoption through the finalization of the I-
600/600A and fingerprints.  Aware of the costs of adoption, we had the money set aside 
for this one time processing fee.   

We had expected to travel to China this winter/spring.  With the delays in the process, we 
are hoping to meet and legally adopt our baby by the end of this year.  Since both our 
fingerprints and I-600/600A forms will expire, we are expected to file a second series of 
I-600/600A and fingerprints.  Long have we thought that the expiration dates should be at 
least 24 months attached with an "renewal fee".  With the proposed changes, not only 
will we have to pay for the second series but at a substantially higher price.  To repay for 
a petition that we were already been approved does not make sense.  To repay for 
fingerprints done last year does not make sense.  

People adopt children for varying reasons.  For us, it is to bring a child into our home so 
that we can love and enrich his/her life.   While doing so, the child will bring so much 
joy to our lives.  Due to the costs of adoptions, not everyone that desires to adopt are able 
to adopt.  Knowing and understand these costs, we were able to budget our money for the 
adoption.  We were aware and agree with the costs to a certain level.  Unfortunately, we 
do not agree with these proposed changes. 

We thank you for your time.
