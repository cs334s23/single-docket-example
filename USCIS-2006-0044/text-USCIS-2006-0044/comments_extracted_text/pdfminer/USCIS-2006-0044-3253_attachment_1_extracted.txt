Subject: Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service 

Re: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, CIS No. 2393-06; Docket No. USCIS-
2006-0044, RIN 1615-AB53  

To whom it may concern:  

I am opposed to the increase in USCIS fees that this proposed rule would permit the 
agency to charge as they apply to international adoption. There are already more than 
150,000,000 orphans in the world, and the number is dramatically increasing each year. 
There are also tens of thousands of American families who want to personally help deal 
with this growing crisis by providing stable and loving homes to some of these orphans.  

Yet the process of international adoption for these families is expensive and often very 
difficult. I don't think that the federal government should be making the process even 
more difficult by increasing these costs as proposed in this rule.  

I support an exemption from the increased fees for everything USCIS does related to 
international adoption.  

Thank you for considering these comments.
