To whom it may concern: 

As a United States citizen, born in this country, I am opposed to the proposed fee increases.  My 
husband and I adopted four children from Belarus between 2001 and 2003.  We would like to 
obtain certificates of citizenship for them, but have been holding off on doing so due to the cost 
($255 per child currently).  We have been hoping that eventually certificates of citizenship would 
be provided to our children retroactively, since children adopted abroad since 2004 have been 
automatically receiving their certificates free of charge.  We have felt for some time that this is 
unfair to those adopted before 2004.  Now we see that a proposed fee increase will make these 
certificates even more difficult for us to obtain!  We are outraged by this proposed fee increase.  
Please consider supplying certificates of citizenship to children adopted abroad before 2004 free 
of charge, or at least don't raise the price!   Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
Ryan and Katherine Lamberton
