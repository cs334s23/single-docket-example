We are writing to object to the rate increase proposed for the I-600A 
and I600 and the N-600.  We are a large non-profit, agency licensed in 
seven (7) states providing international adoption services with eight 
(8) countries.  With the implementation of Hague and the slow down in 
general of international adoptions, this is another burden for families 
and will affect not only the families but the agencies as well.  Please 
do not implement these increases.
