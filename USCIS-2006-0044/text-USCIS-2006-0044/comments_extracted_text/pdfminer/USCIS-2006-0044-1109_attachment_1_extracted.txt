Ref:  DHS  Docket  NO.  uscis-2006-0044: Adjustment of the  Immigration
and Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition  Fee Schedule.

Dear Director:

I am most concerned about a proposed rule by the Citizenship  and  Immigration
Service, the division of the Department of Homeland Security,  to nearly double
the cost of becoming an U.S. citizen and drastically raise the cost of becoming a
legal permanent resident. According to the articles by the Associate  Press issued
on January 31, 2007, the proposal seeks to increase an application  fee for
citizenship from $330 to $595 and the fee for becoming a legal  permanent
resident from $325 to $905.

The proposed rule will disproportionately affect my community  and my family
members. A City of Lowell, Massachusetts is home to the  second-largest
community of Cambodian refugees in the United States with an estimate of
35,000 people, majority of them are Cambodians. According to recent census
data, the per capita income for the Lowell's Cambodians is US$ 6,259; 42.6 % of
them live below the Federal Poverty Level; and only 46% are in the workforce, in
contrast to the national average of 65%.

I hope you will seriously consider the impact that the proposed rule would have
on my family, my community  and my other Southeast Asians living in the  Greater
Lowell who are seeking to become American citizen or permanent  resident.

Sincerely,
