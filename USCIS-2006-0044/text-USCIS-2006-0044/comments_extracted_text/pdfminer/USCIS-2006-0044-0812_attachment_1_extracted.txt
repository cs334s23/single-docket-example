Dear Sir. 

Thank you for all the information on the proposed fee increases.  We are very supportive of the increases 
if, in fact, the positive impact is to adjudicate an I-140 in 3 months or less. 

Is the Department of State also reviewing the National Visa Centerâ€™s role in the timely processing of I-140 
applications?  It currently takes 6 to 9 months for the application to reach the Consulate.  Do they have 
plans to speed this up as well? 

Thanks, 

Karen Fleming
