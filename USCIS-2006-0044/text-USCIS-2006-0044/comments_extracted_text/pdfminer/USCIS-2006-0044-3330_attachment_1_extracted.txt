Dear Congressman, 

As you have already know,The Office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services (USCIS) has increased the application fees to an average of 66%.  
While these increases may not seem to hurt middle and upper working classes 
, it does regrettably affect the biggest population of all: low income 
families. 

Immigrates alone already have trouble seeking for jobs and employment, these 
increases will be a barrier for them to become legal residents or citizens. 
Not to mention, low income families will be financially devastated.  I urge 
you, as a current citizen to take action and void the proposal.
