Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

For thousands of Americans every year, infertility is an issue that cuts to the heart of what our 
country stands for - family.  I doubt that anyone would disagree with the belief that a couple 
should have the right to start a family.  It is a basic human right.  However, for some, this means 
taking extra-ordinary efforts to achieve that dream.  Couples finding themselves in this situation 
already are dealing with heartache and then find themselves facing huge expenses for either 
medical interventions or adoption.  For those who choose adoption, the process is lengthy and 
expensive.  But most couples proceed with the decision as they truly believe they have a calling 
to help a child in need.  There is no greater gift than this.  The wait is often long and the cost 
expensive, making the process difficult both mentally and financially.  Your bill would only make 
this process even more costly and possibly prohibit some of these couples from moving forward 
with this important choice.  If only one child is not adopted because our nation continues to 
increase the costs of bringing a child here to a warm, safe home....then that is to high a price to 
pay.  While we certainly must address the many issues of immigration, increasing the cost of a 
legal adoption in not the answer.  Please consider the impact your bill may have on the lives of 
children around the world and loving couples here at home.  Put yourselves in the shoes of a 
couple fighting the heartbreak of infertility.  Think of your own family...and now imagine not having 
them around.  Then......stop this bill.
