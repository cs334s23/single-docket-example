Subject: DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 

In response to increasing the fees for immigration:  Could you people possibly screw over 
the American citizens and our families any more??  Enough is enough.  Because you'll 
raise the fees and things will stay the same as they are with the  current fees.  USCIS will 
continue to keep losing paperwork, miss- sending documents to people, be rude and 
arrogant and completely unhelpful to the people who are ALREADY PAYING GOOD 
MONEY TO GO THRU THE SYSTEM. 

This in not opinion, it is facts.  There are countless people who have shared their REAL 
EXPERIENCES of being misinformed by USCIS employees, do exactly what they are 
told to do by USCIS employees, and then they find out at the next step of the game that 
they did something WRONG at the advise of USCIS.   

As one person stated to me, maybe USCIS should take lessons from the IRS, because 
they successfully file millions of tax returns in just a few months time.   

Or maybe you should take the fund in Social Security which non citizens pay into with 
their income taxes, you know the one- its "unallocated" and in a category of its own.  If 
non citizens are deported, their family cannot collect the Social Security that they've paid 
into... so take these monies and apply that to your stupid fee increases.
