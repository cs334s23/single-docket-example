Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

We are writing to ask that you do NOT increase the fees to petetion to make an overseas 
orphan an United States citizen. As you may know, adoption expenses are extremely high 
currently. Our family is adopting a special needs toddler boy from China and expect our 
total expenses to run about $25,000! With the fees for each step of international adoption 
as much as they currently are, many families who have the desire to adopt an overseas 
orphan, simply cannot do so due to lack of finances. Please do not increase the CIS fees. 
This will burden even more families and cause thousands of orphans to remain orphans 
because of the high cost of adoptions.  
Thank you for your consideration in this matter. 
Sincerely, 
Ivan & Holly McDaneld
