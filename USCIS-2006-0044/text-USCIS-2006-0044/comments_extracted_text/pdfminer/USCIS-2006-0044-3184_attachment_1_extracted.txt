Subject: DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 

Every time the fees were raised in the past, the whole process slowed down.  Increasing the 
fees does not improve the service, it erases opportunities for those not able to make more 
than minimum wage.  It is un-american to impose financial penalties on those who want just 
to follow the immigrant footsteps of the past. 

Please, do not do this. 

I have a family who were refugees from Togo, a country in Africa. The head of the family was 
forced to join a military organization when he was 12.  Ten years later, the side he was on 
lost the civil war.  He has a price on his head and will be killed if he ever goes back home. He 
and his family came here and became residents and are assimilating as well as they can.  
The kids catch on to English much better than the adults.  Now, they are wanting to become 
citizens.  But, there are five of them and he and his wife work as janitors at the local hospital 
for minimum wages and live in low income housing (with shootings, drugs sales and all those 
other depressing "perks" that came with Section 8 housing). He is a proud man who sees his 
wife one hour a day because they work different shifts.  He is trying to save up enough, but 
cannot get the $1765 needed for the five I-400 before the fees goes up.  And so he will not 
be able to apply for citizenship for another year or more, at least.  Why would we deprive him 
and his family of the security of knowing he belonged here totally?  This is the country he 
chose to come to from the refugee camp.  He wasn't sure at first if it was a good place to take 
his family.  

Is it a good place?  Or is it for the rich only?
