I disagree with the new fees, becouse I have had a bad experience with this service. I 
submited my application in April of 2005 and I passed my test in February of 2006, a 
year ago, and I have not received my appointment to pledge for my citizenship yet, they 
said that my case is delay becouse they are checking my background and I found that 
unacceptable becouse I paid $390 and that was very difficult for me and I havent had the 
opportunity to vote and exercise all my rights as a citizen of this country.   

I think that this department should take in care, the following to identify a person : 

1) First and last name 
2) Full parents name 
3) Social Security number 
4) Full Date of birth 
5) Country of birth 
6) City of birth 
7) Picture 
8) Address 
9) Driver license number 
10) Issue date of the green card 
11) Place of application 

My receipt number is SSC*000852472 

Thank you,
