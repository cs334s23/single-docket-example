Vision is the best manifestation of creative imagination and the primary motivation of human 
action.  It's the ability to see beyond our present reality, to create, to invent what does not yet 
exist, to become what we not yet are.  It gives us capacity to live out of our imagination instead of 
our memory. 
Stephen R. Covey
