Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 - Attn: Director, Management Division: 

Director, Management Division: 

As a mother of two internationally adopted children, I'm asking for 
reconsideration on the proposed increases of the 
current fee structure for immigration and naturalization 
applications.  If approved this proposal would increase the cost in 
filing fees for international adoptions by sixty-six percent. 

The increased fee for N-565 (Application for Replacement of 
Certificate of Citizenship - 
used for name changes) in putting an undue burden on adoptive parents 
and their children, who are U.S. citizens by completion of their 
adoption, but forced to replace the Certificate of Citizenship only 
to change a name on the form.  What other U.S. citizens are charged 
additional fees only by virtue of their given name? 

Proposal USCIS-2006-0044 would include the following increases in 
adoption fees.  These fees hurt families and innocent children.  The 
increase of the following fees could make the difference of whether 
an orphaned child finds a loving home in the U.S. or spends their 
lives in over populated, poor, ill-equipped orphanages overseas. 

Please reconsider the increase proposals of the following adoption 
related fees: 

Adoption-Related Petitions Affected by the Proposed Increase 

I-600/600A (Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative) 
current: $545 
proposed: $670 (increase of $125) 

N-565 (Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship - 
used for name changes) 
Current: $220 
Proposed: $380 ($160 increase) 

N-600 (Application for Certificate of Citizenship) 
Current: $255 
Proposed: $460 ($205 increase) 

Biometric Services (fingerprints) 
Current: $70 
Proposed: $80 

Thank you for your consideration and time in handling this important issue. 

Sincerely, 
Cheryl K. Cain
