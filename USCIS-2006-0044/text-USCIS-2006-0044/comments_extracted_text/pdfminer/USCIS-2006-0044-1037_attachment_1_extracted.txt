To whom it may concern, 

I am a law abiding citizen of the USA.  I don't live off of welfare and 
yet I am struggling. Let me tell you why.  My husband went to Mexico 
and is waiting on his immigration appointment.  Which so far has taken 
2 years and several months.  I am curious as too why the customer 
service of the greatest county in the world costs to speak to someone 
in immigration and yet you can't get a straight answer out of anyone.  
I am employing a lawyer to help with this process but he knows about as 
much as I do.  My husband cannot come back to this country until he 
gets is immigration appointment in Jaurez,Mexico becuase it's the law.  
Yet I can barely make ends meet for my chilren and myself.  I 
understand why there are so many illegal aliens in this country, they 
can't wait 3-4 year to eat, or can they?  Then I stop to ponder, maybe 
it would be better, if I just did what everyone else did and live off 
food stamps/housing/medicaid and then I wouldn't have to struggle so 
much with working and waiting on this wonderful immigration system that 
we have.  I know you probably see millons upon millions of e-mails a 
day and this is another e-mail that will get deleted with out regard 
too.  Just stop and think of what I am saying, I see hundreds and 
hundreds of hispanic americans or hispanics in general receiving food 
stamps and government assistance and makes my stomach turn.  Majority 
of people get off at decent times to pick up their children from school 
and be with them, but unfortunately not mine, I HAVE TO WORK TO SUPPORT 
THEM, BECAUSE MY HUSBAND CAN'T BE HERE TO HELP ME FINANCIAL.  Beautiful 
country we have.  I am not angry at you sirs by any means, I am angry 
at the system.   

Thank you
