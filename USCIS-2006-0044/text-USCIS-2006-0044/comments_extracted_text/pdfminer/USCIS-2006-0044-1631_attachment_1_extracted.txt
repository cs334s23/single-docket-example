To Whom It May Concern, 

Please do not raise fees for Permanent Residence Cards and Citizenship. I am 
a Citizenship/ESL teacher and the proposed increase will prevent many people 
from becoming permanent residents and/or citizens.  The proposed increase 
may even encourage people to enter the U.S. undocumented.
