Subject: Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service 

Re: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, CIS No. 2393-06; Docket No. USCIS-
2006-0044, RIN 1615-AB53  

The increase in USCIS fees for international adoption is unwarranted, unjust and 
discriminatory.  

There should not be ANY fee for a family who is adopting a child from another country. 
The level of scrutiny imposed upon citizens who have already been subjected to criminal 
record checks, medical exams, child abuse clearances and homestudy is unnecessary and 
a waste of time. The USCIS cannot and will not provide a single instance in which their 
process prevented any threat to the US.  

I support the elimination of fees for everything USCIS does related to international 
adoption.  

Thank you for considering these comments.
