Greetings, 

I am writing to express concern about the proposed increase in fees for filing immigration forms.  I 
believe this increase places an undue burden on people who are already struggling to get 
established in this country, a belief that is based on personal experience with a friend who 
immigrated from Russia a few years ago.  As a single mother, she may literally be forced to 
decide between paying her rent and paying these proposed increased fees. 

Thank you for reading these concerns.
