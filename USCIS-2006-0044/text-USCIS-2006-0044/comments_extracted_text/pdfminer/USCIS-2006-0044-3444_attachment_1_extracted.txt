RE:  Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044:  Proposed  Fee Increase

Dear Director,

I am writing in response to the unprecedented massive proposed fee increase for
immigration and citizenship applications.  While fees of course must be adjusted  from
time to time, the scope of this proposed  increase is completely out of scale.

Moreover, the elimination of fee waivers for most applications  will create undue

hardship, particularly for vulnerable applicants such as battered  spouses  and children, and
asylees.  While I applaud the elimination  of fees for the 1-360 (Battered  Spouse Self-
Petition) and the continuing policy of not charging a fee for Form 1-589 (Asylum
Application), I question the sense of eliminating fee waivers across the board for Form I-
485.  The complete elimination of access to a fee waiver for the 1-485 will put permanent
resident status out of reach for the very people you claim to be trying to help: survivors of
domestic violence and persecution.  I urge you to continue the current policy  of allowing
fee waiver requests to be evaluated on a case-by-case  basis.

I further urge you to reconsider  the scale of the fee increase, and to consider
requesting supplemental appropriations from Congress if you feel that operating expenses
are so far above revenue.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Name: VAJ i \  V
