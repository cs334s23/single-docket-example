Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

I am writing in regards to the proposed USCIS fee increases referenced in 
Docket #USCIS-2006-0044.  As an adoptive parent who recently filed forms 
that may be affected, I object to the proposed increases.  I already had to 
pay MORE than 500 HUNDRED DOLLARS to receive my I-171H to bring my daughter 
home.  It also took SEVEN WEEKS to receive this piece of paper.  I've heard 
that some CIS offices are taking TWELVE WEEKS to provide this document.  I 
believe that the current fees and wait times are excessive and I ask that 
you do not increase the fees any further.  I ask that you streamline the 
system to make it more efficient which should ultimately result in decreased 
fees.
