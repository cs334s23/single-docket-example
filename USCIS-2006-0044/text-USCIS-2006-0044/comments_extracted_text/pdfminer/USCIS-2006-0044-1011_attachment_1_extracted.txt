Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To whom it may concern, 

Commenting on the proposed increase of immigration fees. I am against the increase, 
why increase so much? Everything is going up in price  but our wages it is unfair for 
people. all that you are doing is discouraging people to do the right thing. an incease 
would be alright if it was'nt so extravagant!      Thank you
