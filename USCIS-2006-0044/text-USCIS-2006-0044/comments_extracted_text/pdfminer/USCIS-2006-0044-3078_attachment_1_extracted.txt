With such a great need for children to be adopted, please DO NOT increase the fee.  This is 
already an expensive and time consuming process filled with many obstacles.  An increase in 
fees will only make this an increasingly expensive & difficult process.  Please do not penalize 
loving families who are trying to make a difference in childrenâ€™s lives by giving them a good 
home. 

Thank you for your consideration, 

Scott D. Shaw
