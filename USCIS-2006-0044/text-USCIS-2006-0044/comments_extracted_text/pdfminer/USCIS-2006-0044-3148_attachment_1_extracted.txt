Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

We are currently in the process of adopting a child, and hope to do so again.  While it is 
impossible to ‘put a price’ on what it is worth to add a child to our family, and to bring them out of 
an orphanage and into a loving home; the high price of adoption does cause some people to 
hesitate to consider taking this step, when they would otherwise joyfully do so. 

Adoption is expensive enough already, and it is unconscionable to raise fees by up to 66% for 
adoption-related petitions.  Please reconsider this fee increase.
