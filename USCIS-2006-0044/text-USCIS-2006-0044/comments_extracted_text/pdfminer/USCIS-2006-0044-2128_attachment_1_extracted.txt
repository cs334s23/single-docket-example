Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS -2006-0044 

Dear DHS: 

RE: proposed hikes in USCIS application fees. 

The proposed hikes in USCIS application fees will make becoming a legal resident and 
US Citizen and impossible reality for many immigrants in Minnesota.  Minnesota 
Immigrant Freedom Network strongly objects to these increases and asks that DHS drop 
this proposal.  

Thank you,
