Subject: Immigration fees 

Dear Sir or Madam, 
I write to urge you to act so as to prevent the fees for application for residency 
and citizenship from allowing already challenged families and individuals to 
complete their regularization process.  This country has always been a haven to 
others and a model of freedom.  Immigration contributes to its enrichment and 
always has.  There are already many hurdles to clear for those who apply.  Some 
are needed, but a prohibitive fee does not seem to me to help us select the new 
citizen our country should be accepting.  In fact it needlessly hurts the process.  
Please do what you can to assure that the application procedures be as humane 
as possible. 
Sincerely,  
Mimi Jennings 
St. Paul, MN
