Subject: Fee for the green card and the Citizenship application 

The increase in fees for person to apply for their Green Card as well as Citizenship are 
unbelievable. If we truly want people to follow the law then we have to make it within a 
reasonable financial reach. 

 My wife and I make fairly good salaries and I would find this unrealistic. As I am sure 
you are aware most of the people applying  are persons with very little means to 
disposable income.  

I do think that this needs to be a priority and I also know persons that would postpone 
doing either of these because they could not afford to do so. Please reconsider how this is 
done so that we have more legal immigrants in the USA paying taxes and enjoying the 
benefits of living in such a great nation. This; I truly believe and I also believe it is up to " 
us" to help others achieve what we have achieved. Please feel free to contact me if you 
need more input .
