Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern, 

I respectfully request that these fees not be increased.  So many families 
who adopt internationally are on very tight budgets.  These increases may 
make it much more difficult for parents to bring these wonderful children 
into our great country. 

Thank you.
