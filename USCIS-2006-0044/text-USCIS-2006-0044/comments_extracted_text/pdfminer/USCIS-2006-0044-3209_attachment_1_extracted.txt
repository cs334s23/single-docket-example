Do you people not get it ????  
Why in the world would you allow people into this country with no money to support 
themselves??? 
Our system cannot support this type of thinking.. look around and listen what the tax 
payer's are saying "we are getting tired of being responsible to those that are not" our 
medical/health is a good example, I pay almost $475.00 a month (out of my pocket) on 
health premiums alone, and it's not Cadillac coverage I even pay for my own Rx. 
It really hacks me when the irresponsible get free health care ...who pays for this ??? I 
think I am not only paying my own I'm paying theirs. If you folks have all this extra 
money for this program how would you like to pay my health care premiums ?? and then 
I can have "Cadillac" coverage ...   
If these folks can't afford increased fees how will can they afford medical insurance 
?? much less rent, power, food, car, car insurance? without government assistance which 
is payed by US TAXPAYERS......   
"RESPONSIBILITY" is the key word here 
The Takers are "takeing" more than The Givers are able to "give" 
Look around and "Get Real" this has got to STOP
