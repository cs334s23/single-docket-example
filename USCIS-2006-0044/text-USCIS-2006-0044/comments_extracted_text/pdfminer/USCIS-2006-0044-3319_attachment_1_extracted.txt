Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I wish to oppose the increase in fees for a Certificate for Citizenship for adopted minor children.  
As adoptive parents, our children have already become legal citizens and are recognized as such 
by the State Dept. when applying for a passport.  Requiring adoptive parents to obtain a 
certificate of citizenship on their behalf essentially is an unnecessary duplication of effort on our 
part.  Having paid thousands of dollars in adoption fees, increasing the fee to obtain this 
Certificate is an unfair burden.  Therefore, I request that the fee increase for obtaining a certificate 
of citizenship for adopted minors be dropped fromt the proposed schedule adjustment.   

Thank you, Lesa M. Dodd
