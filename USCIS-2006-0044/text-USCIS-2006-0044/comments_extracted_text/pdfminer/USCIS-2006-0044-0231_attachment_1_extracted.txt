Subject: Increase in Citizenship Fees 

DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

I've just read that the fees for citizenship are to be 
raised to almost double of what it is now. I became a 
citizen a couple of years back and didn't have a 
problem paying the amount needed to file, but I'm sure 
that a lot of people, who don't make as much as my 
husband and I, had to sacrifice something else to pay 
those fees. There are a lot of hardworking immigrants 
in this country, who might barely make more than 
minimum wage, who have children to take care of, and 
would love to become a citizen once they qualify, but 
who would already have a hard time paying the amount 
necessary now. I doubt very much they'd be able to 
afford almost $600. Especially considering they'd 
probably want their children to be citizens too (if 
they aren't already). 
I thought maybe the fee schedule could be arranged by 
family income (and number of dependents) rather than 
the same for everyone? I know a lot of folks who do 
manual labor etc and who make maybe half of what I 
make, and I think their work is just as important to 
society, and I believe they should get a break with 
these fees. Also if more than one family member 
applies at the same time, maybe a discount could 
apply? Of course these are just ideas, but I felt 
quite strongly about this, so I thought I'd write in 
for some comments. 
Thanks for your time 
Sincerely
