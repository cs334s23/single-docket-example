Dear Emilio Gonzalez: 

   Good evening. 

   A very disturbing trend in government practice over the past decades 
has been to widen the economic gap between the rich and the poor.  Under 
the guise of avoiding tax increases, fees have grown exorbitant.  These 
fees are seldom based on income level, and hence fall disproportionately 
on the poor. 
   At the same time, immigrants continue to come into the country.  This 
is a desirable thing, as people who want to be here push the country 
forward in many ways.  Most immigrants have almost no money.  Raising 
citizenship and green card fees will only serve to keep out the people we 
should be welcoming the most.  In turn, we will have that many more 
"illegal" immigrants. 
   If anything, citizenship fees should go DOWN.  Progressive taxes should 
pay for the budget of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  At the 
very least, please hold the line on current fees. 

   Thank you. 

Sincerely, 

Michael Monroe
