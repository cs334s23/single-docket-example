Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-006-0044 

To whom it may concern, 

I strongly _oppose_ the increase of Immigration Filing Fees. The applicants 
and their relatives have paid more than the fair shares of the cost and 
expenses. The fees that they pay is far more than the cost of service that 
the applicants receive. It is time for USCIS to improve service but not 
increase fees. 

Best Regards, 

Geoffrey Zhou
