Subject: Docket # USCIS - 2006 - 0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing in regard to the possible increase in USCIS fees to ask you NOT to increase 
your fees to renew our I-171 (Petition to adopt an orphan).  We are currently in the 
process of adopting a child from China and our dossier is in China now as we wait for our 
referral.  The wait time for a referral  in China has been extended and our I-171 expires in 
July.  If we have not traveled by this time, we will be required to re-do our I-171 
paperwork which will mean we will have to pay an additional $2000+ in fees to complete 
this all over again!  Please do not make this harder on Americans attempting to build their 
families through adoption.  If you raise the fees to re-do our paperwork, you will hurt 
thousands of American adoptive parents who are already overburdened at the thought of 
having to re-do our I-171 and refile.  Please do not complicate this by charging us an 
increased fee.  If you must increase your fees, please consider grandfathering us into the 
old rate so that we will not have this unnecessary burden placed on our heads.  
Republican Heather Wilson of New Mexico is currently attempting to pass a bill (Bill 
H.R. 628)  in Congress that will make our I-171's valid for 24 months.  Again, I ask that 
you please hear our request and not increase your fees.
