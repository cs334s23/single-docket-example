Subject: Proposes Fees 

Mr. Gonzalez, 

With all your respect, but the proposed new fees increases, are out of 
touch with reality, we are hard working people, that struggle to make 
end means, we work hard to support our families, we get paid the 
minimum wage, and we hardly cover our rents, food,  and clothes for us, 
and our family, we this increase it will make impossible to even try to 
file a citizen application  or to petition our family member.  Please 
take in consideration that Immigration and Naturalization Services, are 
for people that came to this country to give a better life to our 
children, and we do not had the best pay jobs in the USA, even our 
children had joint the military to advance in their education, most of 
them are just legal alien, and did not apply for citizenship, because 
of money constrain. I hope that you will take  this in consideration 
and do not make unrealistic fees increases. 

Thanks,
