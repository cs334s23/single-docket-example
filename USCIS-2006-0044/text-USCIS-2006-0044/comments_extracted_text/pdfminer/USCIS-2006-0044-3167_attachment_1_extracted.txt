I am single mother to an adoptive child from China.  She was a citizen by law but I have to apply to get her 
paperwork which is costly.  I plea to you not to increase the cost of this paperwork.  It will make it tougher 
and for us that need it, it is not fair.  My second child from China the paperwork was automatically sent 
without additional cost.  Why??? 

Thanks for you consideration in increasing the fees.
