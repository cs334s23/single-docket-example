RE:  DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044
Proposed rule â€” Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Application and
Petition Fee Schedule

I am a student in a citizenship class at 
f\  C jt^5 
studying English and American history and civics to fulfill  my dream to become an American
citizen.  I was very unhappy to hear that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)
has proposed to raise the N-400 citizenship application and fees from  $400 to $675.  I will find it
very difficult  if not impossible  to pay this additional $275 as I was already worried about paying
$400.  Doesn't the USCIS want to build bridges for refugees and immigrants to move towards
citizenship not walls?

in Seattle, Washington.  I have been

I would like to request that USCIS asks congress for additional money instead  of asking
individuals to pay an additional $275.  If this increase occurs, the N-400 fees will have increased
by 71 1% since 1998 (from  $95 to $675).  Except for a cost of living increase, my income has
remained about the same in 9 years.  By signing below, I and my fellow class members want to
let you know that we do not feel this is fair and we ask you to keep the N-400 fee at $400.
Please reconsider your proposed fee increase.
