Subject: Comment on raising application fee by USCIS (USCIS-2006-0044) 

Hello, 

I am family-based immigrant from Russia. I was brought in U.S. on K-2 
visa (dependent child of fiance) last year when I was 19. My parents 
married within 90 days. But they refused to adjust my status because 
it is very expensive and they didn't want to support me and sign 
Affidavit of Support (which I must have in order to immigrate) for me. 
They threatened me with jail and deportation, then just kicked me out 
from their house. They completely abandoned me. Now I am homeless and 
about to turn 21, so I almost have no hope to became permanent 
resident and have no money to go back to Russia (I have even no money 
for buying food, I am staying in homeless youth shelter). I have no 
employment authorization so I can't work legally. 
I know that fee of Adjustment of Status petition increasing 3 times 
from $325 to $905. How I can pay it if I am homeless and may not work 
in U.S? 

Thank you, 
Evgeny
