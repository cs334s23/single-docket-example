 My name is Pirosca Barros , I am a single mother with 4 children and it is just 
unreasonable to pay such high price to be able to get an American Citizen Certificate 
without having to sacrafice other necessary things like food , paying rent , paying my 
electric bill and other expense that i have with the salary that i have .  I think that there 
should be some kind of control over the amount of prices over this applicatios most of us 
have children and it seems that the community has no saying in this process .
