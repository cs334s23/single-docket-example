Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To whom it may concern: 

I appreciate that you have costs and that you must up fees from time to time.  We are  adopting a 
baby from China and we have already done the I-600A process and will have to do it again due to 
the long wait times.  I would appreciate it very much if you would consider giving those families 
who have to reapply a discount the second time around.  The cost of adoption is already so 
expensive and having to pay the fee all over again with the increase is very taxing on families.  
Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Krista and Darrell Fauvel
