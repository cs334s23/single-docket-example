Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing to plead with you to not raise the fees proposed in Docket Number USCIS-
2006-0044.  My family is going through the process of adoption at this time.  We have 
already paid hundreds of dollars to get our I-600A and are going to have to pay those fees 
all over again because the wait time for Chinese adoption has tripled since we started.  
Our papers and fingerprints will expire before we travel, therefore forcing us to go 
through the process all over again.  It's hard enough on our budget to have to find another 
$615 for this.  But if this proposal passes, we will pay another 22% more.  Our adoption 
is costing around $20,000.  This equals half of my husband's yearly take-home pay.  We 
are sacrificing, though, because we feel very strongly about giving an orphan a loving 
home and a forever family to call her own.  Please consider the financial strain we, as 
adoptive families, are under.  Don't raise the fees and make it that much harder on us.  
Thank you for your consideration.
