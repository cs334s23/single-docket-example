Re: Adjustment of the Immigration Benefit Application/ Petition and Biometric Fee 
Schedule  

As a single mother of two boys adopted from Vietnam, I am very disappointed to hear 
that filing fees will be increasing and am shocked at the rate increase.  This increase will 
seriously affect many families who plan to adopt and the children who wait to be 
adopted.  Adoption expenses are already incredibly high and an increase such as this 
could deter many parents and children from becoming families.  In some cases, this 
increase could be the final end in the adoption process as many would be parents simply 
can not afford the adoption costs which include filing fees as well as the costs of raising a 
child. 

I adopted my first son in 1994.  If I am correct the fee for the I-600/600A Petition to 
Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative was $180.  Now is it $ 545 and could be raised 
to $ 670.  This is absurd!  I want to adopt again, but what may stand in my way is the 
$25,000 adoption costs.  Adding another penny to these costs could prevent me from 
finding the child that waits for me in Vietnam.  It would affect all of our lives. 

Please do not increase the fees for adoption-related petitions.  Please do not jeopardize 
the lives of the many children who can be adopted by Americans and the parents who 
long for the child to come into their families.   

Most sincerely,
