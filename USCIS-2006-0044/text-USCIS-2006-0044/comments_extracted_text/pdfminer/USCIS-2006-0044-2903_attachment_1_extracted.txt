To Whom it May Concern, 

I highly encourage you to look at the necessity in raising your fees for filing the I 600 or I 
600 A.  

Adoption is a long journey in and of itself, and very expensive. The cost to adopt alone is 
is enough to keep some very worthy people from sharing their loving homes with 
children who so desperately need and deserve a home and parents to call their own. 

Please do not perpetuate the current trend that indicates only those with money can adopt. 
Please allow those families who want to share their homes with waiting children the right 
to do so. 

Sincerely, 

Genevieve & Joseph Bauer
