Subject: docket number USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear Sir/Madam: 

I am deeply concerned by the sharp increases you are planning in USCIS 
fees. In simple terms, you are demanding a substantial increase in 
cost up front, but don't promise to deliver improved service until a 
long time down the road. This flies in the face of any basic customer 
service business, of which yours is one. 

And while you try to justify the fee increases on the basis of the 
high cost of the equipment needed to process applications and 
fingerprints, you don't say anything about what you have done to 
improve productivity in the agency. You can have the best machines in 
the world, but if the humans using them continue to use them and 
interact with their customers at the current snail's pace, we will be 
no better along. 

Show me that you can speed up processing times for international 
adoption documents such as the I-600A and I will support a measured 
increase in your fees. Until then, No.
