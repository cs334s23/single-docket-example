Dear USCIS,  

The proposed increase in fees is extremely excessive.In smoe cases it is many times over.  It creates such a 
heavy financial burden to applicants. Please make the increase smaller if needed.  

The immigrants do pay taxes. Why some of the tax money not allocated for immigration services?  

Thanks for your willingness to reconsider your proposal.
