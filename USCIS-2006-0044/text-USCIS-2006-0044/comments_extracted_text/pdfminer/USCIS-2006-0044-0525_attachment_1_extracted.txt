Comment of increase of fees: 

I was expecting increases to come but not at such a dramatic increase.  I think it is unreasonable 
to increase the fees to this degree.   
It would be more logical for fees to increase at a more gradual rate.  They could plan to continue 
to increase the fee as a long term rate over a four year period for example so that the fee would 
increase $40 each yearâ€¦but to increase it all at once in this large amount seems very drastic and 
much higher than national inflation rates.  Students are not even getting the increase in minimum 
wages yet! 

Example  Year One:  OPT I-765   $180   to  $220 
               Year Two:                    $220  to   $260  . 
                Year Three:                 $260   to  $300   
                 Year four:                   $300   to  $340
