As an adoptive parent I am strongly against the increase in fees.  I feel that this is only 
punishing those individuals who are legally becoming citizens.  We plan to adopt again in 
the future and for those who do not know, adoption is a very expensive process.  To have 
the fees increased is going to make it harder on the adoptive families who are already 
paying lawyer and agency fees to bring their forever families together.  I stongly urge that 
this proposal does not pass.  Why punish the people who are legally going through the 
immigration procedures?  Let's focus on getting a handle on illegal immigrants entering 
the U.S. 
Thank you for your time in listening to a concerned adoptive mother, 
Lisa Garza
