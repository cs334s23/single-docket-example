Subject: [Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044];[FR Doc: E7-01631];[Page 4887-4915]; Immigration: 
Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I wish to express my belief that the proposed fee increases by the U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (USCIS) are beyond excessive – they are exorbitant. Do not change the 
fees – immigrants cannot afford the current fees, much less the new proposed fees. 

Sincerely,
