Subject: Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service 

Re: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, CIS No. 2393-06; Docket No. USCIS-
2006-0044, RIN 1615-AB53  

To whom it may concern:  

I am opposed to the increase in USCIS fees that this proposed rule would permit the 
agency to charge as they apply to international adoption. We have gone through this 
process numerous times, and since adoption is already so expensive, and these children 
are not threats to our national security nor to our economy, they should be waived. Thank 
you for your fullest consideration.
