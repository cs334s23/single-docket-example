Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

 I have read in today's newspaper of the projected  increase in cost in 
applying for US citizenship, incorporated in DHS Docket No. 
USCIS-2006-0044. 

As presented, I oppose this raise. 

Do you not think that it smacks of trying to get rid tof "illiegan 
aliens"?  There is great controversy about  "aliens", illegal or not.  
Most of it seems to be raised against Hispanics, most of whom earn very 
low wages, pay taxes,  anad try to send much of their earnings to their 
families back home, to help them escape poverty. 

Do you know any RICH  "aliens"? 

I have a daughter-in-law who is Vietnamese.  She is applying for 
citizenship, after meeting the residency requirements.  She is a 
well-educated person in her homeland, and made her living alone in 
Singapore before she maarried my son.  She is currently studying to 
become an aesthetician to add to her husband's income.  She would makae 
a godd US citizen. 
BUT the new price will be difficult for her to pay! 

And there are MANY like her in this country. 

Do not let your prejudices agaianst "aliens" -- i.e. foreigners -- keep 
us from adding more good citizens.  In the face of this projected raise 
(and the bureaucracy that accompanies immigration and citizenship 
proceedings), I wonder sometimes why anyone wants to become a citizen!!!
