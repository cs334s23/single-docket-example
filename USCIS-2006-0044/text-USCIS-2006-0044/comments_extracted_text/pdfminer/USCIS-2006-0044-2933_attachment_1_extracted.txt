Subject: Docket : USCIS-2006-0044-0001 

Hi. The fees for USCIS services associated with 
international adoption should not be increased. It is 
costly for us as adoptive parents to bring these 
beautiful children home to their forever families. As 
we all know the United States is the best place in the 
world to live and raise a family. I ask that you would 
please consider leaving the fees as is and allow more 
families to enjoy the wonders that international 
adoption brings. Thank you very much for your time. 

Sincerely---Ann Kuebler
