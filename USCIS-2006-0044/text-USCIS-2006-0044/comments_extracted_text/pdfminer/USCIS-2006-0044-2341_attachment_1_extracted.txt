Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing you on behalf of families involved in adopting orphan children with regard to the 
proposed rate increases. There are so many charges that one incurs when trying to adopt a child. 
It not only involves the current charges that USCIS charges but also all of the paperwork, agency 
fees and then the travel that will be involved. 

Since the rate increases will not result in more services that will be provided, please do not make 
this change which will result in greater hardships on families who are already sacrificing trying to 
make a difference in a child’s life. I think that the amount of time that it takes just going through 
this process is a big enough hardship. Please don’t add anymore. 

Please reconsider the proposed changes. 

Thank you.
