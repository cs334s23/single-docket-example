To Whom It May Concern: 

I  am writing  in  response to  the  exorbitant inaease in  application  fees for immigrants, 
refugees and asylum seekers entering the U.S.  The fee increase, which is in some cases is 
triple the  current rate,  is  said  to  cover the cost of background checks performed by  the 
FBI.  There are two  most notable objections to  this  added  expense.  First,  individuals 
entering the U.S.  for any purpose other than a vacation are already required and receiving 
background checks for clearance to enter and remain in the United States.  This seems to 
beg the  question "why would the  government allow individuals to enter the country for 
more  than  a  holiday  if their backg-ound is of  such a nature  as  to  prevent  them  from 
attaining U.S. citizenship?" If individuals are deemed safe to remain within U.S.  borders 
for  months,  even  years,  why  then  would  they  need  yet  another  background  check? 
Second and  lastly, the majority of individuals immigrating or seeking rehge within the 
U.S.  do  not  possess  the  extra  funds  to  cover  such  an  increase  in  application  costs. 
Refugees in particular, often have larger families to care for and those anriving from the 
third world generally have a longer and more difficult financial road to travel.  I therefore 
to  amend  the  increase  in 
urge  USCIS  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  S&ty 
naturalization application wsts in consideration of those who will be future Americans. 

Sincerely,
