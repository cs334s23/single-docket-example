Dear USCIS: 

I am writing as a concerned U.S citizen to oppose the 
proposed application fee increases due to the deeply negative 
impact it will have in my community and many others.  The increased fees are 
enormous averaging about 66% whereas an individual's salary increase 
is significantly less, averaging from 5-10%. 

Permanency and citizenship are essential processes to full integration 
and participation in American society. Many low-income families simply 
cannot afford such high fees and will be forced to choose between the 
immediate needs of providing for their family or paying for 
application fees to achieve their dream of becoming permanent 
residents and citizens. Creating additional barriers of increasing 
fees will not only discourage many from applying but essentially deny 
many refugees and immigrants access to integrating and achieving the 
American Dream. This country is strengthened by the contributions of 
refugees and immigrants of all backgrounds and it is in our nation's 
best interest that we ensure that the path to citizenship is 
accessible for all eligible immigrants. 

I urge USCIS to find alternative solutions to offset of the 
administrative costs of USCIS, such as getting the U.S. Goverment to 
allocate funding for your valuable work. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, 

Atiyyah Edwards
