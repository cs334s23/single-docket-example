USCIS Comments 

Dear USCIS Comments: 

I am writing to you as an international educator in opposition to the 
February 1, 2007, proposed rule "Adjustment of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule."  The 
proposed fee increases are so exorbitant they will act as a disincentive 
for international students and scholars to study and work in the United 
States.  USCIS must reconsider the role of appropriated funds to meet the 
administrative needs of the agency.  I ask that fees be reduced to the 
actual cost of processing the application or petition.  

As an F-1 approved school the main fee that needs to be addressed is the 
following: 

   â€¢The near-doubling of the I-765 fee for international students in F 
status to apply for work authorization for Optional Practical Training, 
from $180 to $340.  In addition, if a student has economic hardship and 
needs to apply for the EAD card via the I-765, the higher costs associated 
to simply apply certainly defeats the opportunity to try to get themselves 
out of economic hardship. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. 

Sincerely, 

Tricia Wempe
