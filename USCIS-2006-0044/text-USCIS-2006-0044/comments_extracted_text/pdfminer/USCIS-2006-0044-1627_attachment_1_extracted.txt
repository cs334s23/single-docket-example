Dear Sirs and Ladies: 

I have read the proposed fee increases for naturalization application as 
well as for permanent residency.  These will prohibit many of our ESL 
students who would like to pursue naturalization from doing so because of 
the steep increase.  Please reconsider this proposal and keep the fees at 
the present amount or, if they must be raised, please raise the fees by a 
much more suitable amount.    Thank you for this consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Karyn Turner
