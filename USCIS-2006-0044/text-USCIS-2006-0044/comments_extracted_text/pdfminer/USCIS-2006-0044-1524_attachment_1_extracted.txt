USCIS Comments 

Dear USCIS Comments: 

I am an international educator. I am writing to oppose the February 1, 
2007, proposed rule -Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule.  

The proposed fee increases are exorbitant. If implemented, the increases 
will have two deleterious effects. First, some individuals who would 
normally be inclined to submit petitions for CIS review/adjudication will 
choose not to do so. Let me share an example. From time to time I advise 
individuals who are seeking to extend their B-2 visa status. At the 
current fee level, many wonder if it is worth their while to pay the fee. 
They want to know the consequences of saving their money, not  submitting 
an extension request, and overstaying their visas.  No doubt the proposed 
fee increase (from $200 to $300) to request an extension of status will 
dissuade many individuals from complying with the regulations. Note that 
my example is one of the smaller fee increases; many of the fees will 
increase by more than 100%. 

A second effect is that the proposed fee increases will serve as a 
disincentive for CIS to develop more efficient procedures. What reason 
will CIS have to streamline activities or eliminate outmoded procedures if 
to do so reduces CIS's revenue stream?   

I hope that you will join me in opposing these fee increases. 

Sincerely, 

Jim Hamrick
