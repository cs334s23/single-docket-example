Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

We are writing to oppose the fee increases as proposed in USCIS-2006-0044 as relate to the 
international adoption of children.  

As natural-born American citizens, we have found it nearly impossible to adopt a child 
domestically because since we are over 40 years old. Our only viable option according to the 
adoption agencies has been to adopt internationally â€“ which we are doing. Yet the costs to adopt 
one orphaned child are staggering. Many of us would gladly provide loving homes for more of 
these children were it not for these costs. The legal and administrative costs alone account for a 
large portion of the tens of thousands of dollars needed to adopt just one child. It is disheartening 
to now find out that our own government is getting ready to increase our fees by what is an 
unbelievable percentage.  

As Americans, we put such an emphasis on helping those in need. The sacrifices to do this are 
great. Let us not penalize the orphans in the process.
