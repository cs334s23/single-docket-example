Subject: Fee Increase 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I would like to ask that you reconsider increasing the fee for immigration petitions especially for 
orphan children.   As a Mother of a child that I adopted from China in 2005, I know first hand the 
cost of adopting a child & that is why I ask that you please reconsider this or make an exception 
for petitions filed on behalf of orphaned children.    

I would great appreciate your consideration to this request. 

Sincerely, 
Patrick Yates
