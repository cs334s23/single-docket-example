Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Dear Sir/Madam -  

Upon review of the proposed increase of adoption fees we are opposed to such a 
marked increase.  These rates are going to make the dream of having a child out 
of reach for many especially those of us who are having to pay these fees twice 
due to China's slow response time.  Please, we beg of you, do not let our dreams 
die because of increased fees.  Many of us have already paid a priceless amount 
with the emotional toll thus far without even counting the financial toll for our 
heart's desire of becoming parents.  We cannot help that China has slowed down 
and should not be penalized for such.  It is also very hard to understand why the 
fee is going up 140%.  Please reconsider the fee increase and leave it as it is.  
The fingerprints need only be collected once and kept on file as our fingerprints 
do not change.  A nominal fee if needed, could be charged to run them again in 
situations where they have expired due to the adoption Country's pace.  Please 
do not increase the fees, it is not just about the money, but about the emotional 
toll of not being able to adopt after all due to the fees being out of reach. 

Thank you for your consideration.
