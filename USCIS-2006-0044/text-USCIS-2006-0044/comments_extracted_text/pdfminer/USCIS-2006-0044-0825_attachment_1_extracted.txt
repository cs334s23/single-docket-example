Subject: proposed fee increase for USCIS applications 

To Whom It May Concern, 

Understanding the constraints under which USCIS operates and is expected 
to process applications for all kinds of immigrants and non-immigrants, 
I nonetheless find it unspeakable that our government and this agency 
would try to balance the budget on the backs of those who have the least. 

My international students, some of whom may be applying for employment 
authorization due to SEVERE economic necessity, cannot afford $340 for 
the application to gain said authorization.  In addition, graduating 
seniors hoping to gain a year of valuable work experience, are also 
strapped for cash and this is a TREMENDOUS hardship for them. 

Please reconsider this increase, and let's take the cost of our onerous 
immigration requirements off the shoulders of those who cannot afford 
it.  I pay my taxes, and I would gladly cover my share. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Amy E. Webber
