Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

My husband and I have been in the process of an international adoption for two and 
a half years.  This has been a long emotional, as well as, financial whirlwind.  I was 
forwarded this information concerning the rate raise for the adoption petitions and I 
have to say I am floored by the hike in fees.  Adoption is an already mountain of 
money for the families who are called to bring a child into their home, most who are 
unable to have children of their own.  We are asking that you reconsider these fee 
increases.  Many of us are having to pay twice for these petitions, which is already 
an increase to the expected cost.  Please do not raise these fees. 

Thank you for considering this request from an adopter.   

Chris and Alex Liotta
