It is ridiculous to raise prices for these documents.  As a single parent who has adopted 3 
children, it is expensive enough without further increases in prices.  Furthermore, the longest wait 
for ANY document is the form I-171H from CIS.  It is impossible to get a human being on the 
phone and ridiculous to think that a price increase is going to do anything for customer service.  
Why not concentrate on getting the forms processed and COMMUNICATING with prospective 
and post adoption parents.  If you are raising fees to increase staff, communication, and 
expediting turn around times on documents--communicate that and maybe more parents would 
agree with the fee increase.
