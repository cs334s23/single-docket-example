Subject: RE: Docket No.USCIS-2006-0044 - Adjustment of Fee Schedule 

Dear Sir/Madam: 

     We feel that the proposed adjustment to the Immigration and 
Naturalizaton Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule is onerous 
and unfair.  The proposed increases are steep which would was very 
disadvantageous to a lot of immigrants who are really in the lower rung 
of the economic ladder. 

     Please reconsider the proposed fees and propose instead very 
modest 

increases.  We support that smooth operation of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service but please do not increase huge increases in 
fees 

that would put to a disadvantage the group of people that you are 
trying to serve. 

Yours sincerely, 

Jaime G. Olazo
