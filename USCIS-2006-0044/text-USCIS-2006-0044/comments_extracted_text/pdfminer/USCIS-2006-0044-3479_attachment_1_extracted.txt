To Whom It May Concern, 

I writing regarding the proposed increase in citizenship fees from $400 to 
$675. I was informed today, the last day to voice my opinion on this issue. 
I strongly oppose. This will have a detrimental effect on New Americans. 
New immigrants will in no way be able to afford this increase. How in any 
way is this going to be benefit New Americans?
