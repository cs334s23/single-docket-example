Dear rule makers: 

The proposed immigration fee increase is huge with little benefit to affected immigrants. 
For I-485 the 178% of fee increase will result a 20% of shorten of processing time does 
not make much sense.  Besides if the promised 20% shortening of process time is not 
delivered, will the immigrants get refund of some sort?  Affectedl immigrants do not 
have the option of not paying such a big jump of fees if it is get approved.  And affected 
immigrants do not have the power to vote it out either.  I hope USA will stay as a just 
country, if not it will not be worth to immigrate to USA.  

May God bless America!
