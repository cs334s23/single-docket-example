RE: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

I am writing to you to let you know how I feel about the proposed fee increases from USCIS.  
I feel the increases are extreemely high.  
I also feel that they are not fair to immigrants that are seeking citizenship who have gone through 
all the correct processes. 
I am making a request that the US Congress appropriate sufficient funds to the USCIS for 
legalization processes.  
This request comes from a registered voter. 

Regards, 

E.Lee Carter
