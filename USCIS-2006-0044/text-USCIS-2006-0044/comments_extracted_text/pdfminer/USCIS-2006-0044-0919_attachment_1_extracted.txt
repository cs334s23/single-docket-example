Subject: Fee Increase 

I am totally against the fee increase.  For one: 

Calling the 1-800 # is a joke.  Customer Service is horrible and yet, USCIS would like to increase 
processing fees.   USCIS will still be providing the same bad, rude, Customer Service as always.  
I have over a dozen recordings within the past 3 months of the type of Customer Service that has 
been provided. 

I would love for the person responsible for the 1-800 number to explain this.  Two of the calls are 
from Supervisors.  It's really unbelievable.  I think the next time  
 Congress has it's hearing, maybe some of my tapes should be heard......And these so called 
"Officers" can explain the "Quality Service" that they claim they are providing tge public. 

The public needs to speak out about USCIS and the type of Service that takes place over the 
phone and in person. 

UNBELIEVABLE! 

How does the fee increase help if you are subject to an FBI name search that has been pending 
for two or more years.  Will this fee increase allow for other agencies to expedite there 
processing?  Will USCIS inform the public about filing a MANDAMUS against the Service. 

UNBELIEVABLE 

Look at the Service that is being provided with the so called new website.  This new USCIS 
website has gone back in time. 
With all the latest technology out there, and after viewing other more sophisticated websites like 
"Shusterman.com 
how could USCIS put something out, that still to this date have broken links.  The old website was 
much easier to navigate and  
the font was better.  This new dull website has to be a joke.   However, you would like to increase 
fees. 

I can not even order forms on line, but you wanna increase fees. 

UNBELIEVABLE
