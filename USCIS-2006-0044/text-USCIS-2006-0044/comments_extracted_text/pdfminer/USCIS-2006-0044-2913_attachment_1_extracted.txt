Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS- 2006-0044 

I am deeply, DEEPLY opposed to these fee increases.  People who 
have adopted children from overseas have already spent increadible 
amounts of money on their adoption and related travel expenses 
etc.  When the adopted child of an American citizen sets foot on 
American soil, we are told, that child becomes a citizen 
automatically.  BUT we are asked to pay exorbitant fees for the 
"certificate" which is proof of that citizenship?  It is cruel and 
unusual punishment to inflict this upon a usually already financially 
strapped family.   

In the case of our own situation, our adoption took place during the 
summer of 2003;  our children arrived in August of 2003 to take up 
permanent residency in the US;  this was less than six months 
before the "certificate of citizenship" became automatic for 
children who qualified.  It would have been really nice if there had 
been a "grace period" of, say, six months, so that children who 
arrived during that time frame could have received their 
certificates retroactively.  However if we wish to have our two 
children receive that certificate, we are expected to pay a 
tremendous amount of money (TIMES TWO!!!) for each certificate 
(we adopted TWO children).  Our children have been home over 3-
1/2 years now, and we have still not been able to afford the two 
certificates as it is.  Yet now it is proposed that this and a number 
of other fees are to be raised???  I implore you to reconsider!!! 
sincerely, gail shulman, mother of one homegrown American citizen 
age 15, and two adopted "imported" American citizens, ages 14 and 
12-1/2.
