Subject: Comments -- USCIS Proposed Fee Increases for Adoption 

(I sent this comment a few minutes ago but forgot to list the Docket Number. 
Therefore, I'm sending it again. Thank you.) 

Regarding:      Proposed Fee Increases for Adoption-Related Petitions 
                U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
                Docket Number USCIS-2006-0044 
                Public comment period 2/1/07 through 4/2/07 

Comments: 

I am an adoption social worker employed by a licensed child-placing agency 
in Washington State, and I have assisted families with international 
adoptions for the past 15 years. While I understand the need to update and 
improve USCIS's ability to provide timely, accurate service in processing 
adoption petitions, and the associated budgetary concerns, I find the 
proposed new fee schedule excessively burdensome to adoptive families. The 
cost of international adoption is already edging beyond what many Amercian 
families can afford. Dramatically higher USCIS fees will have the effect of 
discouraging many American families from responding compassionately to the 
needs of orphans in other countries. The result will be a loss for thousands 
of orphaned children and the American families who wanted to reach out to 
them through adoption. Therefore, I urge the USCIS to consider implementing 
lower, more reasonable fee increases than those currently proposed. Thank 
you for your consideration of this comment.
