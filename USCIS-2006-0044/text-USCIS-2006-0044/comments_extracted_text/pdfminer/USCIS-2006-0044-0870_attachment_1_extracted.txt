I do like the new changes for 2008/2009.  The one thing that I really like is 
that it would go faster; it would not take that long for application.  I was 
little concern when I saw an estimate pricing.  For N-400 right now 330.00 
and for 2008/2009 it would increase to about 595.00, itâ€™s a big change and it 
increased by 265.00, wow.  All of the other things I really like, however 
price increase is concerning me.
