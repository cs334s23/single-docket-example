Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern,  
I would like to voice my displeasure concerning the proposed fee increases proposed by the 
USCIS.  I particularly wish to voice my concern about the fee increases that would be subjected 
to families pursuing international adoption.  These increases would not affect my family as we are 
completing our adoption but my concern is for the millions of orphans throughout the world.  The 
cost of adopting a child internationally is prohibitive but increasing the fees may ultimately prevent 
families from going through with an adoption and only prevent a child from leaving an orphanage 
and into a family.
