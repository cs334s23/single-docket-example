Subject: Docket No. US-CIS-2006-0044 

My view of the proposed change in the processing fees for all immigration and citizenship 
 applications is that the department of Immigration is possibly the worst government department I 
have experienced in the US. They are without doubt the rudest, unhelpful, disorganized,slow and 
poorly run of any I have had the unfortunate necessity to deal with. 

The fact that they want to increase an already outrageous cost for any of these services (and I 
use that word loosely) is unimaginable. I have lived in this country for 18 years and the US-CIS 
has been the most difficult to deal with. Raising the cost for all their services with only an 
estimated 20% increase in productivity is unrealistic. The renewal of my Green Card was a 
mission in patience and after 8 months of waiting, 3 visits to the CIS office and waiting for hours, I 
finally got my card, only to find that when re-entering the US the card 'had not been activated' , 
what ever that meant, and no-one would tell me why, how or to whom I should talk to get the 
problem fixed. No amount of increased fee will solve the personnel problem and mis-
management.  

The increase will only make the illegal entry into this country more of a necessity and make those 
who wish to go through the process legally, less like to.  

I absolutely disagree with the proposed increases.
