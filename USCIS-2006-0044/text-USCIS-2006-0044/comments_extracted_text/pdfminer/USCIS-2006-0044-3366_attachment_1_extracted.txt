RE: DHS Dockct No. USCIS 2006-0044 

Dear Director of Regulatory Management: 

I write in strong opposition to the proposal by the United States Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (USCIS) to increase the fees for starting the naturalization process. 
Under the USCIS'  proposal, the fee for filing the Form N-400 would increase from $330 
to $595, and the biometries fee would increase from $70 to $80, resulting in a total 
increase h m  $400 to $675. The proposed 69% fee hike is an unfair burden for 
hardworking newcomers who wish to become U.S.  citizens and participate in everything 
that this nation has to offer. 

Currently, many newcomer families have limited resources, and they work tirelessly to 
save up the money required to pay the current $400 naturalization application cost. 
According to data fiom the U.S. Census, about one-third (36%) of non-citizen households 
have annual incomes that are less than $25,000. Family members oRen want to pursue 
U.S. citizenship by applying for naturalization at the same time.  With the increase 
proposed by the USCIS, a family of f ~ w  would confront a bill amounting to $2,700. An 
exorbitant price tag should not stand in the way of families seeking to realize the 
American Dream. 

I do not oppose applicants paying a fee to apply for U.S.  citizenship and commend the 
USCIS for taking the steps to improve customer services and processing times.  I also 
understand that the agency believes it needs to raise fees to pay for major infrastructure 
investments and process enhancements, such as improvements in the timeliness of 
background checks, modernization of its outdated business systems, facilities 
improvements and enhancements in its personnel training and recruitment programs. 
However, placing the full costs of these investments on the back of our nation's  legal 
pamanmt residents is driving fees to a level that immigrants simply cannot afford. 

I urge the USCIS to work with the President and Congress to obtain appropriations to 
supplement fee revenue to cover costs of major USCIS expenses such as infrastructure 
investments, process enhancements and cap&]  improvements.  In the past, Congress has 
appropriated monies to assist the USCIS id facing challenges such as its application 
processing backlog.  The USCIS believes it needs to make sipflificant investments to 
build an IkniGon 
that should be met through the partnership between applicants paying a reasonable fee 
and the appropriation of Congressional funding. 

Senice for the 21''  Century.  This is p*&sely  the type of challenge

Immi&~ants who apply for U.S.  citizenship are eagcr io demonstratr thcir co~lltnilment to 
this country by becoming full l>ilrticipailts in our nation's  civic life.  If they cantlot 
become U.S. citizcns because of an unfair fce hike, we will all lose an oppoltunity to 
strengthen and revitalize our demolrracy.  Our nation has a tradition of welcoming 
newcomers hecausc of tllcir contributic!ns  to our cconolnic and social progress. The 
IdSCIS'  proposed  fce incrcase is contrary ti) the spirit o f  this 11-aciition ant1 e n d s  
ncwcc!mer.s the wrong mcssage nt a time whcn they are e c k i r ~ g  to en~hract. 
U.S. citizetlship.  1 tirge yon lo halt the proposed naturalization  fee incrcase, and seek 
ilppropnatecl limding to hclp covcr the investments the IISCIS needs to pi-ovidc quality 
services at an affordable price. 

Thank you  for your consiclci-ation of my vicws. 

Sinccrel y,
