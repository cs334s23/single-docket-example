Dear Regulatory Management Division, 

After much consideration and prayer, my husband and I made our decision to adopt a 
baby from China, back in January of 2006.  We worked as quickly as was humanly 
possible, and finally submitted our paperwork to China on 7/28/06.  Although we were 
told the wait time would be approximately 12 months, we are now looking at the 
possibility of waiting up to 17 months, or longer.  Was this our fault?  No, however, we 
are now faced with having to update our "expiring" documentation, which includes 
paying hefty fees all over again.  I know China is doing their best to process our 
paperwork quickly and match us with a baby, but it is our own government that seems to 
be working against us.  I'm still trying to understand how it is that our fingerprints could 
expire after a year?!  Anyway, I'm sending this to you and asking, respectfully, please 
don't increase the fees as outlined in this proposal.  It is completely out of our control to 
be this delayed, which is already a painful realization for us, so please don't punish us 
further by stretching our financial limitations as well. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this email and for your thoughtful consideration of 
this matter. 

Sincerely, 
Heather & Tray Halverson
