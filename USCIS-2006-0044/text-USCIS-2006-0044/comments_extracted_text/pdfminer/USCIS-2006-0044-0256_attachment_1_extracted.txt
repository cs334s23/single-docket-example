Subject: PUBLIC COMMENT ON DHS Dockett No. USCIS-2006-0044 

I am writing to express my opinion about a proposal to  
increase fees for immigration and naturalization  
benefit applications and petitions.  
In a newspaper article I read, it was stated that:  

"Garcia-Upson said the agency is funded primarily  
through revenues from application fees.  

Revenues from the proposed fees would be spent on  
hiring and training, technology and making services  
more efficient. The improvements should reduce average  
application processing times by 20 percent by the end  
of September 2009, she said.  

Applicants now pay a $70 fingerprinting fee. The  
agency wants to increase that to $80. Fees are also  
paid for work permits, for replacing lost green cards,  
for petitions to adopt orphans from other countries  
and for other benefits."  

I SAY, Raise the fees to cover your costs. I WILL NOT  
agree to supplemement the costs of immigrants' paper  
work to come to AMERICA. If they are going to be  
granted naturalization , they should be able to :  
1. Follow a legal process  
2. Afford to pay the fees for that process.  

If they cannot do either, We should not grant them  
permission to LIVE in our country.  
Thank you.
