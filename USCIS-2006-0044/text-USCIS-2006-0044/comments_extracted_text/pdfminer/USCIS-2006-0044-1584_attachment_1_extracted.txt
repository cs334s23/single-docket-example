Please don't raise the rates.  Most families adopting from overseas are 
doing so because they have no hope left of either adopting locally or of 
having their own biological children.  The cost of reaching that point is 
expensive enough.  Add to that the fees for international application 
processing (including processing for I-171) and most families are at the end 
of their financial rope.  This is made even worse by the fact that most of 
us will have to be processed twice because of 171 expiration mid-process. 
This rate increase, small though it may seem, will make a big financial 
difference for many of us. 

Please don't raise the rates. 
Sincerely, 
Candice Manyin
