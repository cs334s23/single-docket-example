Subject: Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am submitting a commment on the USCIS proposed increase on the processing fees of most of 
its applications and petitions.  While I understand the necessity to increase the fees to be able 
to process documents in a timely manner, I believe the proposed increases are too high.   

Examples of the proposed fees include:  
OPT (I-765) current: $180, proposed new fee: $340 
Change of status (I-539) current: $200, proposed new fee: $300 
Replace lost I-94 (I-102) current: $160, proposed new fee: $320 

The above examples will put an added finacial burden on students trying to earn a degree.  As I 
review the list of proposed hikes to the processing fees that are listed on the NAFSA website; 
there are many fees that double and still others that nearly triple the processing fee.  I would be 
interested to understand how the USCIS determined the increase of these fees. I understand that 
there have been delays and backlogs in the processing of USCIS fees; however, it is hard to 
believe that doubling the fee to process these documents will somehow make the problem go 
away.   

I think the thing that bothers me most is that the USCIS has been notorious for delays in 
processing and lack of service... and now they want to increase the fees extensively.  As an 
advocate for our students, I believe that such an astronomical increase of the processing fees 
unfairly punishes the Students and Immigrants for the USCIS's inability to efficiently and 
effectively process forms. 

I am not against a marginal increase; however, in the business world, it would be unheard of to 
give a raise to a person that continues to show that they are ineffective. 

Please rconsider the reducing the increase of the proposed fees. 

Sincerely,
