Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS 2006-0044 

To who it may concern, I would like to express my 
strong objection of raising the cost of residency and 
citizenship of this so called land of freedom. The 
price now for many immigrants is an impossible hurdle 
when is this country going to stop exploiting the easy 
targets. 
Thank you 
Cecilia Arredondo
