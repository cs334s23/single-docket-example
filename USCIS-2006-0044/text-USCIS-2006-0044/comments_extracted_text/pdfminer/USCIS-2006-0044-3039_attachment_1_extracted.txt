"Adoptive Parent -Cecilia Gray" 

To Whom It May Concern, 
I am a parent who is waiting for my little girl from China.  And with the increased wait 
time, we are seeing the reality of having to renew our documents with the USCIS because 
our paperwork is expiring.  I feel that it is unfair to adoptive families to have to renew our 
I-171H and our fingerprints because of the wait time increasing in China.  In all reality a 
person's fingerprints do not change after they are fingerprinted.  So why is it necessary to 
waste your time and mine to get re-fingerprinted?  I hope that you can keep the fees 
where they are until we (adoptive parents) can be granted the opportunity to extend the 
validity of our I-171H & fingerprints with the bill trying to be passed in Congress right 
now.  Once the expiration is extended for these two important parts of our process, then 
we won't have to be renewing both of them a second and sometimes a third time.  Overall 
it is more costly for everyone involved. 

Please hear all those adoptive parents out there and their pleas for the fees to stay the 
same.  With the wait time increasing, that puts more costs to the family for their adoption 
expenses.  Adoption still needs to be a wonderful alternative to those who cannot have 
children.  The more expensive it gets, the less families there will be to adopt those 
children who do not have a family or a home.  Please keep our costs down so we can 
bring those children home to wonderful families. 

Sincerely, 
Ceci Gray
