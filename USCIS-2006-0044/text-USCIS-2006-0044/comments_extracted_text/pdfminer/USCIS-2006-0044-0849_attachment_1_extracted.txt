Subject: INCREASE OF FEES.... 

HI 

IF INCREASE IN FEES WILL RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICES SPECIALLY 
REDUCES THE WAITING TIMES  I THINK IT IS 

A GOOD IDEA . 

HOW EVER AS SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT LIKE IT  AND THE COSTS MAY NOT BE 
AFFORDABLE, SO HOW ABOUT, 

TOW DIFFERENT RATES  IE... EXPRESS SERVICES AT A HIGHER RATE   AND NORMAL  
SERVICES AT  A LOWER  RATE. 

GOOD LUCK
