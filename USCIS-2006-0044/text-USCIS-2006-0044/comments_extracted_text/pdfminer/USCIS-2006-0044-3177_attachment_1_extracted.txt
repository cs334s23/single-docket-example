Dear Sirs, 
I am a constituent, and I have learned about the proposed increase in Immigrations fees. 
If we compare the amount of money the USCIS receives already to process all of the 
immigrations benefits it provides, we have yet to see an increment in the efficiency and 
accuracy of the service with the type of funding USCIS is already getting before thinking in 
increasing the fees much more. 

I think this increase will impose a burden to aliens filing for immigration benefits when in the 
past it has shown not necessarily an improvement of services. And this is based on real people 
stories we learn about every day, not from statistics calculated in a computer. 

I think USCIS has to elevate its efficiency and improve the services with what it has going on 
now regarding funding, and not to ask for more money from the people, who in the past have 
not received a real expedited service. 

USCIS has yet to reorganize much more internally to offer a better service and prove to all 
Americans how well is the money being spent, before pledging for more funds when these are 
really needed to expand operations and truly improve the quality of services. 

I oppose this increase in immigration fees. 

Sincerely,
