Creating a Market Driven Foreign Guest Worker Cap in Software Occupations
By Roy Lawson
May, 2006

In February 2000 Gary Cohn and Walter Roche of the Baltimore Sun coined H-1b visa holders working 
for high tech staffing companies as "indentured servants".4  There are problems with the H-1b visa that 
harm immigrant workers, American workers, and in some cases all workers.  There are deficiencies in 
the law, inadequate enforcement, and some companies who choose to skirt the law entirely.  These 
points aren't discussed in detail, however one must acknowledge that problems do exist which are 
outside the scope of this work.

Congress is currently debating a major increase of H-1b guest worker visas in high tech occupations. 
According to the USCIS, the majority of H-1b visa holders are concentrated in software related 
occupations.3  Because of the disproportionate number of foreign workers in the software occupations, 
an arbitrary raise in the H-1b visa cap will harm American software professionals more than any other 
profession.  American corporations have requested a market based visa cap that does not account for 
the labor conditions of American software professionals.  This work aims to provide a market-based 
method of arriving at a total numerical cap for all foreign guest worker programs that accounts for 
labor conditions in software occupations.

A numerical cap for all foreign guest workers specific to software related occupations is needed to 
prevent the harm of American software professionals; such a cap should be based upon employment 
measurements collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  There are several measurements of 
employment originating from the BLS that may be useful in determining the labor market's ability to 
absorb foreign workers without displacing American workers.  

Some industry groups claim a shortage of software workers and that foreign workers are required to 
meet a labor demand that American workers cannot fill.  According to the BLS, current growth in 
software jobs is not keeping pace with the rapid growth experienced in the late 90's.  Figure 1.0 depicts 
a downward trend in software job creation since the year 1995 when applying a linear regression 
model, contradicting claims that there is a general shortage of software professionals in the United 
States.  Software jobs growth in 1998 is 292 percent higher than the same measurement in 2005. 6-17

The Current Population Survey (CPS) measures both employment and unemployment at an 
occupational level.  We are able to track job growth and unemployment in software occupations using 
this data since the mid 1990's; it should be noted that the CPS methodology is not perfect given 
methodology changes which may impact a time-series.  However, the BLS has indicated that the CPS 
is the most reliable source of employment data at an occupational level.  BLS data relating to 
employment are explained in detail on the BLS website.5

There are two rules in determining a numerical foreign worker cap that won't harm American software 
professionals.  First and foremost, don't displace American workers.  Second, stop the flow of foreign 
guest workers when the economy sours and Americans are unable to gain employment.  Using these 
two rules, we can state that the cap must come from job creation.  If the market is not creating jobs we 
could conclude there is a low demand for additional workers.  We can also state with confidence that if 
unemployment rates are trending upward the market must be sour.

Figure 2.0 depicts growth in software jobs (a combination of four software-related job categories) from 
2001 to 2005.6-17   Data indicates growth in jobs since 2002 and a loss of over 100,000 jobs since 2000 
during peak IT employment.  The same regression model beginning the previous year depicted a 
decline in job growth, meaning the software job market reversed course in 2005.  Unemployment data 
indicated the same favorable trend from 2001 to 2005 and is depicted in Figure 2.1.

When calculating a numerical foreign worker cap, we must first determine if the job market is capable 
of absorbing the additional workers without harming the American labor market.  A reasonable 
definition of a healthy job market would be one that trends upward using a linear regression model 
given five years of historical data, while unemployment trends downwards over the same period using 
the same model.  Such trends are depicted in Figures 2.0 and 2.1.6-17

If it is determined that employment during the prior five years trended in a favorable direction 
historical growth can be used to calculate foreign worker numerical caps.  One suitable formula would 
set the cap at a fixed percent of average job growth during the previous three years after accounting for 
unemployment.  A baseline measure derived from three years of trailing data would produce a more 
stable cap, reducing the impact on both corporations and labor caused by outliers.  A sample worksheet 
is depicted in Table 1.0.6-17

* Software Employment and Unemployment is a comb ination of Computer Scientists, Systems Analysts, 

  Computer Programmers, Computer Software Engineers, and Datab ase Administrators.

** Employers are rewarded when unemployment rates are b elow 2% for the purposes of this study.

   Unemployment ab ove 2% is adjusted for, providing relief to unemployed American workers.

*** A sustainab le cap is a total for all foreign worker visa programs and applies toward new visas issued, not renewals.

     It allows for new opportunities to b e split 25/75 b etween foreign and American software professionals.  Negative growth is changed to 0.

Using the example depicted in Table 1.0, we arrive at a cap of 7,378 for software occupations in 2005 
given that the previous five years trended favorably when a linear regression model was applied.  From 
years 2002 through 2004 the cap was reduced to zero given negative job growth and an unfavorable 
linear regression model.  Under this model, guest workers already present are not required to exit the 
country during a sour job market.  American workers are protected from high unemployment or job 
loss, while corporations are rewarded for keeping unemployment rates low.  The steps for calculating a 
sustainable foreign guest worker cap are expressed in Table 2.0.

As employment conditions improve companies should have access to more foreign guest workers, 
however American workers should be protected if employment conditions reverse course.  This sample 
model offers such protections for both labor and business.

2. Determine Annual Job Growth (A) = Current Year Employment (E) - Prior Year Employment (E-1/yr)
3. Smooth Job Growth (B) = Average 3 years of historical Annual Job Growth (A)
4. Determine Total Software Unemployment (U)
5. Determine Unemployment Exceeding 2% (U1) = U-((U+E)*0.02)
6. Adjust for Unemployment Exceeding 2% (A2) = B-U1
7. Determine Sustainable Guest Worker Cap in Software Occupations (SCAP) = A2*0.25

When comparing sustainable guest worker numbers with the actual number of guest workers approved, 
it is clear that the number of foreign guest workers entering the United States is too high and is in fact 
displacing American software professionals.  Table 3.0 depicts the number of H-1b visas approved in 
software occupations from the years 2000 to 2003; the approval data originates from USCIS Reports on 
Characteristics of Specialty Occupations.1-3  Complete historical data is not available for comparison, 
but in the case of each year depicted the number of H-1b visas approved exceeds what this work 
defines as sustainable.  During the year 2001 a total of 139,000 software jobs were lost while the 
number of H-1b workers approved in software occupations was a staggering 110,713.  This is a 
difference of 249,713 jobs.  

In a single year, nearly one quarter of a million American software professionals either lost their jobs or 
were displaced to foreign guest workers on the H-1b visa.  This scenario is exactly what must be 
prevented in the future by implementing a more sustainable market driven system.  Guest worker visa 
programs should prevent the displacement of American workers by halting the flow of additional 
foreign workers when the labor market sours.  In 2001, the current system failed American workers 
causing widespread hardship.

The demand for new software workers is much lower than it was in the late nineties.  In recent media 
reporting you will find that prominent business and political leaders claim a shortage of technology 
workers, however to date there is no mention in most media outlets that software occupational growth 
in 1998 was 292 percent higher than it was in 2005 or that from 2001 through 2002 there were 262,000 
software jobs lost.  There is little discourse on a sustainable guest worker program.  That must change 
if the software profession is to remain a viable career choice in the United States.

If the supply of foreign labor is not reduced to sustainable levels the demand for American labor will 
go down and negatively impact American software professionals.  A market based approach as detailed 
in this work addresses the legitimate concerns of both American workers and American business.  This 
approach is based upon the concept of fundamental fairness; foreign guest workers are intended to fill 

4

one-fourth of newly created jobs while at the same time not displacing American software 
professionals.  In the event that American workers experience long-term job loss or or unemployment 
this system offers an additional safety-net driven by historical employment trends.  Any future claimed 
shortages should be addressed by encouraging more students to pursue the computer sciences, not 
through foreign labor subsidies that discourage students from entering software related occupations.
