Immigration should be less costly, not more.  The 
important thing should be such efforts as community 
service and  civics and history classes, not charging 
people more money.   Immigration is already too costly 
for people.  If people want to come into our society, 
we should welcome them.   Our country has always been 
built on those people. 

Illegal immigrants too should be given an easier path 
to citizenship, in terms of cost, but should have to 
do community service (no jail time) and  study civics 
and law and english and so on (though english should 
not be the official language of the US). 

Thankyou. 

Paul Kane
