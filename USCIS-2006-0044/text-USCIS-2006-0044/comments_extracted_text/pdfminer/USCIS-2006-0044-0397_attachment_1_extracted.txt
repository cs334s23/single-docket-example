My comment is short and simple.  You constantly refer to ensuring sufficient funds to 
meet immediate national security and also promise to reduce backlogs, for example, in 
Adjustment of Status cases to 4 months.  How will an "increase in fees", to the CIS, 
decrease the amount of time the FBI and other related agencies take to do 
background/security/name checks?  Every time a local or even regional CIS supervisor 
has spoken at an AILA(American Immigration Lawyer's Assoc.) event, all we are told is 
that "Security/Background checks" DELAYS are beyond CIS'control.  How will the 
backlogs be alleviated without their cooperation?  You cannot rationally nor consciously 
expect to charge exorbitant fees and your response to the individual's inquiries on the 
delays is:   "Security/Background Check delay" 

     ***In the entire Proposed Rule, I do not hear/read any mention of how these 
Security/Background check delays will be alleviated by the increase in fees. ***
