Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

As the friend of a prospective adoptive parent, I am extremely 
concerned by the proposed  fee increases by USCIS as they relate to 
international adoption.  

Probably half of all international adoptions take two years from start to 
finish. With the I600a expiring in 18 months and the fingerprints expiring 
after only 15 months, this would result in many prospective adoptive 
parents having to pay those fees twice.  This would mean a $250 
increase for the I600a for these potential adoptive parents  
The fingerprints will cost people $160, not just $80, because the USCIS 
requires parents to be re-fingerprinted, instead of using the original set 
fingerprints for the second investigation. The result of these fees is the 
USCIS is in essence  
pressuring prospective adopters to choose the “faster” programs over 
those that may be more established, stable and ethical. 

I am strongly opposed to the increase in these fees.
