Subject: Citizenship proposed increased filing fees. 

too many people are trying to do the right thing by filing for their citizenship; most of 
whom are very low income earners.  Without your citizenship documents job 
opportunities are closed off to people. The cost of living is through the roof; people are 
struggling.  Honest people are trying to make an honest living.  It is hard to live dayby-
day. Minimum wage and other low income earners simply cannot afford to pay the 
astronomical increase filing fee for applying for citizenship.  I sincerely hope that this 
drastic action will be reconsidered.
