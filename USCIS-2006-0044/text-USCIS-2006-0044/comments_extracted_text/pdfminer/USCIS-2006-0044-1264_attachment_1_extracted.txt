Subject: immigration fee hike 

Dear USCIS,

I, Maggie Domfeld, am deeply concerned with the proposed increase in the application fee for U,S. citizenship and other 
immigration benefits. 

I believe that USClS should find a solution that promotes, rather than discourages, immigrant integration.  I believe the 
fee increase would discourage low-income legal immigrants from pursuing permanent resident status and citizenship. 
This is clearly a strike against integration efforts.  Encouraging integration is in national interest because it strengthens 
national security  Inviting and involving immigrants in our society's public institutions is good for our nation. 

The United States is a nation that is strengthened by the contributions of newcoiners of all backgrounds.  Raising the 
obstacles to integration goes against this legacy. 

Finally, I believe the cost of processing immigration and naturalization benefit applications and petitions should NOT be 
on the backs of prospective immigrants. I believe Congress should appropriate money for tecl~~~ology 
and infrastructure 
improvements at USCIS, 

Sincerely, 

Maggie Dornfeld
