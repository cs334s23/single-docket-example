Subject: Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

As a legal immigrant of more than thirty years, I ask you please not to increase the fees for 
Permanent Residency Applications. The existing fee can already cause hardship to many 
moderate income people like myself who have to choose to pay fees or put food on the table. I 
support legal immigration and do not want to withhold the benefits of legal residency granted to 
my family, from otherwise law abiding immigrants, because of their inability to pay a huge 
increase in fees.
