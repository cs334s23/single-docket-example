Hello, 

As the husband of an immigrant who has been waiting for 14 months for a Visa Interview and 
another 11 months for an decision on an i601 waiver. First I oppose the fee increase for any one 
who has already started the process.  Doesn't make sense to punish folks with new fees who 
have been waiting years in some cases as my wife has. Make any new fees only apply to those 
who have not yet filed.   

Then second any new fee structure should be tied to specific backlog reduction numbers and if 
any part of the application process takes more than a few months those fees should be returned 
to the applicant.  

Thanks for considering my opinion. 

David
