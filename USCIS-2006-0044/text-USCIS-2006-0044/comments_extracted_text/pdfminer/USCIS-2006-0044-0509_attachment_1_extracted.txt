Subject: Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

As an immigration attorney, I was taken aback by the announcement of fee 
increases once again for USCIS filings.  I currently have clients who are eligible 
for citizenship and would like nothing better than to be U.S. citizens, but the 
current fee of $330 for filing the N-400 has set them back.  Having to provide 
eyeglasses, medical coverage, a roof over their heads and food on the table have 
taken priority.  Whenever they approach saving enough to file, something 
inevitably occurs for which that reserve is needed. 

Now you propose to raise these fees.  How are working people, which is what 
these immigrants are, ever going to keep up with the layers of bureaucracy we 
continue to impose?  Placing the burden on immigrants is tantamount to saying 
"Get out of here.  We don't want you anyway."  The cost for insuring our security 
is every citizen's duty and should not be foisted upon those who do not receive 
the benefits of citizenship.   

Respectfully submitted,
