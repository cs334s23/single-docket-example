Our country cannot put a high enough price on the privilege it is to live and work legally in this 
country.  I can't believe it is so inexpensive to become a legal resident or citizen of the United 
States.  This is a priceless privilege in the world today and your fee increase is not only very 
reasonable, it is cheap!!  The immigrants who are complaining about the fee increase need to 
realize that living legally in the United States is an honor beyond any price.  The fact that they 
have any say in this matter is attributable to the many rights accorded to our citizens and should 
make them more grateful that they can even apply to become legal residents and/or citizens.  I 
think your fee increase should even be higher to reflect the true value of living in this great nation!
