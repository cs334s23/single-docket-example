Dear USCIS, 
I have just been made aware of the fee increase you plan to implement. As an adopting parent on our 
second adoption I ask that you reconsider the increase. We already have to pay an enormous amount of 
money to bring these children home to their forever family. Too many people do not proceed to help the 
children because of the cost. Please consider all the children that need homes so badly and the families 
trying to bring them home. We need to make it less difficult not harder.  
Thank you, 
RenaeSchuiteman
