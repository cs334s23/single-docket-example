Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Thank you for hearing my statements regarding fee increases on immigration/adoption 
expenses.   

After reviewing the explanations and reasoning behind your desire to raise fees I have a few 
comments that I think are worth airing.   

First, I see that the workload has decreased rather than increased.  In the rest of America, private 
and business, when work decreases we lay employees off or cut back in other areas.  This might 
be the best approach for the government as well instead of paying people for doing less or no 
work. 

Second, I have no problem increasing fees in a reasonable fashion, if necessary, but to increase 
an average of 66% is ridiculous; especially when there is less work to be done.  When it comes to 
those of us who are adopting children, the costs are already enormous, coming up with additional 
monies to pay these types of increases is going to be an inordinate burden and stress on not only 
the adults but will reduce the amount we have to spend on our children, such as health care and 
insurance.  So instead of adopting a whole new social program like "Hillary care" why don't we 
just keep fees reasonable and let us take care of our own business. 

I also have a suggestion.  Since there is less work to be done at CIS, why don't you transfer 
some of the workers down to the Mexican border to fill the vacancies left by our agents who are 
now in jail for doing their jobs...if anyone is willing to go to work for a country who elevates 
criminals over its law enforcement heros. 

Sincerely,
