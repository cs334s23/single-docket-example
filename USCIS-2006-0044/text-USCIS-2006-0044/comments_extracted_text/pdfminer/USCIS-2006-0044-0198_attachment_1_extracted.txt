Subject: Ridiculous Proposed Fee Increase by CIS 

Dear Sir or Madam, 

I find the proposed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 8 CFR 
Part 103, CIS No. 2393-06, Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044, RIN 1615-AB53 
regarding fee increase (on average a 66%+ increase per application) in 
filing U.S. immigration paperwork completely OUTRAGEOUS! 

How can the government of this country, a country formed by 
immigrants, make the new immigrants or those who have been here 
lawfully for years and wanting to settle in this country in lawful 
ways to pay for the inefficient government workers and stupid 
immigration systems! 

Stop abusing those new helpless immigrants by doing whatever you want to! 

Susan, completely disappointed and frustrated by your stupid immigration system 
and who has been paying U.S. taxes for more than ten years but still 
anxiously awaiting for a stupid visa number in order to be eligible to 
file an adjustment application
