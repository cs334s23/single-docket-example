Dear CIS, 

I am writing to ask you not to increase the fee for citizenship  
certificates for adopted children from other countries.  There's  
simply no logic to it:  these certificates have since been made  
automatic for foreign adoptions.  In fact, there should be no fee at  
all to retroactively get a certificate for a foreign child adopted  
before that rule change. 

As it is, $265 is quite steep.  Over $400 might be prohibitive for  
many families. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Jason D. Patent
