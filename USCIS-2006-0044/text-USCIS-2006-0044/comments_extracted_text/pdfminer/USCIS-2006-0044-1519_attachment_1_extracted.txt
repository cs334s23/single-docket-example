I strenuously object to the proposed increases in the fees that USCIS assesses for 
citizenship applications and for related services. 
The new fees are like a second wall, a profound obstacle to full membership in our 
society.  In addition, the inability of many immigrants to pay the new fees will encourage 
even more of them to slip into unofficial status, which works against the government's 
interest in increasing security and reducing the numbers of undocumented residents. 

Please reverse this proposed fee increase. 

Sincerely, 

Anna Boekstegen
