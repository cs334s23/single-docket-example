To whom it may concern,  

I am thoroughly disgusted with the handling of our borders and immigration.  I do believe 
that increasing the fees for becoming a citizen is a great move.  We do not need more 
poor people coming into the country when we cannot even take care of the ones that are 
here already.  Importing poverty is one of the worst things that this great country can do.  
If the border is not closed off, if present laws are not enforced, and if things continue on 
the path that they have been our country will implode from the strain.   

I feel that if President Bush's plan of amnesty goes through there will be a huge backlash 
with violent repercussions.  If this plan goes through, and a huge group of people are 
given no reprisal for the laws that they have broken, then our system of justice fails.  At 
that point, why not forgive any person that has ever stolen from the government, cheated 
on taxes, sold or used drugs, raped a child, or any other of the countless laws that we 
have to protect us.  Giving amnesty to criminals, in any sense of the word, is 
reprehensible.  I implore you to enforce the laws that we have on the books already.  No 
papers, no living here, end of story.  

Sincerely,
