I have great concerns regarding the enormous fee increase for  
applicants to become U.S. citizens. 

These 66%-76% increases will allow only the well-off to apply for  
citizenship. There are many people wanting to become citizens who  
will work, pay taxes, and be good citizens. but be turned away  
because of the high fees. Families need not apply. This country is  
not only for single or wealthy people. 

Many citizens are concerned about the number of illegal immigrants.  
This extensive fee increase will exacerbate this problem rather than  
alleviate it. 

If fees must increase, they should increase at a more reasonable rate  
such as 5-10%. We must give people at all economic levels the  
opportunity to 
apply for citizenship.
