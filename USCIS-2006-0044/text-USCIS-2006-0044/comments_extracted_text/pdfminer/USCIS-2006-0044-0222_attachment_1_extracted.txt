Subject: Fee increase for K1 visas 

As someone currently in the process of obtaining for my fiance, I am against 
a fee increase. Between form fees, medical, processing fees, AOS, etc, the 
fees are already very expensive. However, if a fee increase would speed up 
the process significantly at the California Service Center (perhaps to the 
speed of the Vermont Service Center) then I'm sure people wouldn't mind so 
much. However, no one wants to pay an extra couple hundred dollars to move 
at the same speed.
