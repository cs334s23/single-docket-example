I am writing to you from the Resettlement Division of Jewish Family Services in Baltimore. 

We are against the raise in fees!!! 

Our clients can hardly afford the costs right now.  Raising the fees would just cause more clients 
to have to file for hardship and no charges.  This in turn would cause us  

To have to fill out more forms for them in order for them not to pay. 

When these refugees come to our country, they are lucky to even get the lowest paying jobs in 
our society.  These incomes certainly do not afford them the opportunity  

To pay the fees associated with their applications.
