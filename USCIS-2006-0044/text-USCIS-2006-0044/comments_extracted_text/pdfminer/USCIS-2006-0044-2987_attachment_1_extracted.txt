To Whom It May Concern:  
I am an educator who works with adult ESOL Programs that serve newly arrived refugees.  Many 
of these individuals desire to become U.S. citizens as soon as they are eligible. However, many 
of them spend years working in low entry jobs because their professional credentials from their 
home countries do not transfer to the U.S. As a result, increasing citizenship fees will make it 
increasingly difficult for these individuals to pursue the dream of U.S. citizenship.  
I propose that USCIS creates a system that citizenship fees are on a sliding scale based on one’s 
income level.  The new fee a mount should be the maximum, with the possibility of lower fees 
depending on one’s income.  It saddens me to think that citizenship to our nation would be out of 
reach to some people because of fees, and I believe that our country has a responsibility to 
ensure that those who want to pursue citizenship are not prevented from doing so for financial 
reasons. 

Thank you,
