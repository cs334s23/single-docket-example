Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS -2006-0044 

As a natural-born US Citizen with immigrant parents, I am disturbed and appalled 
to hear that the financial barriers for becoming a US Citizen are getting more 
difficult. It is understandable to raise fees in accordance with inflation, but 
inflation does not grow by 600% (In 1998, the Citizenship application was $95. 
Now it has been raised to $330). By raising fees so high, it certainly appears that 
the US only accepts wealthy people in its citizenship. Are we discriminating 
against poor people because they want to be Americans? They want to be able 
to work? They want to pay taxes? They want to practice their civil duties?
