REF: U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES,  
          DOCKET NUMBER USCIS-2006-0044 

I oppose passing the fee suggested by USCIS. 
Please reconsider the increase in fees for the I-600/600A, the N565, the N-600 and 
Biometric Services (fingerprints).  An increase of 66% makes no since when the current 
inflation rate is only 2.42%. 

Those of us that are in the process of adoption pay considerable costs just to adopt.  Many 
of us have already paid these fees.  I am currently waiting for a referral from China as are 
many other families.  Due to the Hague treaty the process of adoption has slowed down 
considerably.  We will to have to re-file the I-600A for and have fingerprints done again.  
We've already paid these fees once and having to go through this again with even higher 
costs is very difficult emotionally, very time consuming and financially difficult. 

We are also pleading with the Judiciary committee to extend the validity of the I171H 
form and fingerprints from 18 months to 24 months.  The CIS and those adopting would 
be far better off if the recommendation to extend the time is passed.  And, I don't 
understand why fingerprinting has to be done again when fingerprints do not change. 

Another comment I would like to make is in behalf of aliens trying to become legal 
immigrants or citizens.  We have had much discussion in this country about what to do 
about the growing population of illegal aliens.  Why would you want to make it more 
difficult for someone to become a legal immigrant?  I believe approving the increase in 
fees would adversely effect many future Americans.
