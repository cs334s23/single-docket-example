application fee schedule adjustment 

27 March 2007 

Dear Citizenship and Immigration Services and Department of Homeland Security, 

I understand that it with last fallâ€™s election it may appear to be open season on tax-payers, but to subject 
the perspective parents of adopted children to such draconian increases in fees is unconscionable!   

Out of hearts of love and generosity, these couples put themselves through personal invasion and 
expense, jump through incredible hoops of bureaucratic red tape, suffer through months of heart-breaking 
setbacks and delays.  The LAST thing they need is to have big brother come along and indiscriminately 
raise the fees!  If you are short of funds, stop wasting money on global warming studies, the mating habits 
of fruit flies and affects of classical music on alligators.  Stop funding the lifestyle of illegitimate parents 
while penalizing loving and caring adoptive parents! 

Leave these dear people alone!  They are already spending thousands upon thousands of their personal 
resources for the right to love and nurture a child.   

Thank you, 

Robert L. Marsh,
