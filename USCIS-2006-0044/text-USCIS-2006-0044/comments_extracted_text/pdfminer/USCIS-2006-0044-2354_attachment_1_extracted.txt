Subject: DHS Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044 

I respectfully request that the fees for Orphan Petitions and Fingerprinting does not 
increase. 

Adoptive parents are facing significant fees as is. When adopting internationally we have 
no choice but to file with USCIS and the increasing fees are becoming overwhelming. 
Some countries are taking longer and longer to adopt from and it is requiring families to 
file two Petitions for one adoption. 

The increased fees are just adding to the burden for families wishing to adopt 
internationally.  

Please no increase in the current fees. 

Respectfully,
