I completely disagree with Immigration fees being raised. First of all, if I were to 
agree with the fee hike (because I understand inflation affects us all), they would 
have to be lower. Secondly, this seems more like an attempt to curb illegal 
immigration, and it's missing the point altogether. Those who are willing to 
apply for citizenship or residency should not be punished with paying higher 
fees to pay for those who are unwilling to come here legally.  
The tighter we make our immigration laws, the more the problem will slip 
through. Do not raise these fees. We should make it easier for people to come here 
legally, not force them to come here illegally because they can't afford to even 
apply. 

Sincerely, 
Brittany
