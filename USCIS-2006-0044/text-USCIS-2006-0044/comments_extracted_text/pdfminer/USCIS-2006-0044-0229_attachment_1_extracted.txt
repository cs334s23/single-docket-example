Dear Sirs, 

I belive that your new fee schedule will place an undue burden to the LEGAL immigrants 
who are applying for citizenship. Since you will be increasing your fees does that mean 
that your response time is going to improve?  Currently your pocessing time is 
HORRIBLE, so I hope that you plan on  cutting your processing time in half since you 
have doubled the fees for this service.
