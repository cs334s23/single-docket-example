Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I would like to comment on the following portions of this proposal: 

I-600/600A 
Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative 
$ 545 
$ 670 

N-565 
Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship (used for 
name changes) 
$ 220 
$ 380 

N-600 
Application for Certificate of Citizenship 
$ 255 
$ 460 

Biometric Services (fingerprints) 
$ 70 
$ 80 

As an adoptive parent, I am very concerned about the large increases in fees here 
(approximately a 69% increase). Adoption is already very expensive and quite a financial strain 
for many families. These increases will make that less affordable for many people. While our 
government does promote adoption with the tax credit, these fee increases go the opposite 
direction. With international adoptions costing approximately $15k-35k, every little bit makes a 
difference. Please reconsider and not raise these fees.
