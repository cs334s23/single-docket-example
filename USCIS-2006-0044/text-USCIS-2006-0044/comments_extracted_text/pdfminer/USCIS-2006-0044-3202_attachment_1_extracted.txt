application fee schedule adjustment 

I am asking that you reconsider the increase of USCIS Immigration Fees. We have just completed an 
international adoption, and with the time that it took us to do this, we had to fill out the I-600a two times 
($525 + $545 = $1070) as well as be fingerprinted three times ($70 x 3 times x 2 people = $420). So in 
our case, as with many many others, any increase that is made to the fees is usually paid by the families 
more than one time. For a form as straightforward as the I-600a, an increase of $125 is quite a jump.  

Thank you for your consideration of our comments.
