Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

As an immigrant myself I think itâ€™s very unfair to hike up the rates for citizenship and green 
card applications. I know that the fees have been increasing over the years as per inflation 
but never an increase of up to threefold! This is a surefire way to cause hardship for 
immigrants who are not as well off and/or to eliminate them out of the running altogether. I 
sincerely hope this is not the intention. Coming from a country that has used underhanded 
methods to keep unwanted immigrants out, I do not think this is the ethical step to take.  
I understand that admin costs increase but over the years, I have not seen a rapid 
improvement in processing times even with rate increases. If the rate hikes are implemented, 
I hope it translates into faster processing times and fewer cases falling through the cracks, as 
promised. 

Thank you,
