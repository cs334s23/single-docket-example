Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

I am writing concerning the proposed fee increase.  Families adopting internationally have to pay 
this fee and now due to the increased waiting period will most certainly have to be refingerprinted 
and our I600-A will expire and we have already planned to have to pay the fees a second time.  
Now with the fee increase this will only add to the costs.  It seems quite redundent anyway and 
the extra fee just stings even more.  Please consider families adopting internationally and how 
much paying twice already is before you increase the fees for fingerprinting and I600A fees. 

Thank you for your time and reconsideration of this issue, 
Deborah Webb
