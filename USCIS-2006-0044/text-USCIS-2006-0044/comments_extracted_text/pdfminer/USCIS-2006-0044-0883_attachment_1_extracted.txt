Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom it May Concern: 

I must say how disheartening it is to hear that USCIS is considering raising fees for biometrics 
and I-600 or I-600A applications. My husband and I joined the world of intercountry adoption 
almost two years ago. We are currently waiting (along with thousands of other US families) for a 
little girl from China. Our fingerprints will expire this June, and our I-171H expires in September, 
and our adoption will not likely be complete for at least another year--maybe more. So we will 
have paid all of the USCIS fees twice before we are finished. Adoption fees as they already stand 
are cost prohibitive for many families. Not long ago I wrote to our congressman regarding a bill to 
extend the time before expiration on the I-171H.  

It is a well-known fact that I get only one set of fingerprints in my lifetime. I would support raising 
the USCIS fees IF I only had to have my fingerprints taken one time and IF I could pay a (much) 
lower renewal fee for a second I-600A application after 18 months. As things stand now, raising 
the fees just looks like a good way for the government to make money, since there are so many 
families waiting in line for international adoptions. Governments or individuals making money on 
intercountry adoption is exactly what the Intercountry Adoption Act that will enter into force for the 
US this year is set up to prevent! 

Thank you for your time. 

Respectfully,
