Re:

Proposed increase in CIS fees for citizenship forms

To Whom It May Concern:

I
I am the General Counsel of For This Child, Inc. (FTC), a Dallas-Texas based child placing agency.
write to request that, in light of the proposed fee increases for citizenship applications, USCIS take
appropriate steps to protect American citizens traveling abroad against criminal activity.

Specifically, I request that USCIS require the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala to accept, as payment for
processing of applications for orphans' visas for adopted children, non-cash payments. The Embassy
currently has capacity to accept credit card payments but often is unable to process credit card
payments. Adopting parents are therefore instructed, by FTC and other child placing agencies,
to
carry cash sufficient to pay the visa application when they travel to Guatemala for pickup trips.

Such parents are targets for criminal activity.

If, however, parents could be assured that they may make credit card or check payments, they would
not be forced to carry large sums of money when traveling to Guatemala.

On behalf of FTC, I urge you to make it a priority to protect U.S. citizens traveling to Guatemala to
pick up their adopted children by ensuring that they can make non-cash payments for visa application
fees at the U.S. Embassy.
