Subject: Docket #USCIS-2006-0044 

To Whom it may concern- 
  I have been working on getting my wife & stepdaughter situated in 
the U.S. for near 3 years. After experiencing this process first hand I 
am humored by this proposal to increase fees. If this passes I would 
suggest you start providing a quality service also. I have never dealt 
with a bigger bunch of idiots in my life ANYWHERE! These people 
can screw up a free lunch. Im ashamed to talk about our countries 
immigration system now that I know how it works. If a private 
industry ran anything like this is being done it would be history! It 
also is scarey to know that these people cant even handle a little 
paperwork let alone watch out for our safety. Please take this one 
step at a time and have them get their act together before giving 
them more money to flush! 

Thankyou- Ralph Bruder
