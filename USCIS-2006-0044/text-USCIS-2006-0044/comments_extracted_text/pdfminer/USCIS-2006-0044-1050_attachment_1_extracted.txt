Subject: [Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044];[FR Doc: E7-01631];[Page 4887-
4915]; Immigration: Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 
I am an immigration attorney in Denver, Colorado.  

The proposed fee hikes to the adjustment of status application and 
naturalization application are unduly harsh. The fees are already 
expensive and to make adjustment applicants purchase applications which 
may or may not be applicable borders on extortion.  

You are taking advantage of people who have no choice but to undergo 
this process. You are making it very cost prohibitive for people to 
apply for these benefits - particularly naturalization, as several LPRs 
see no real benefit in applying for citizenship in the first place.  

It's a travesty that instead of asking the American people to fund this 
process; you are making the foreign individuals who benefit America 
bear the entire cost. You likely will prohibit those people from coming 
or becoming US citizens.
