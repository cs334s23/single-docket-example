To Whom It May Concern, 

I am writing concerning the proposed fee increases of the 
fingerprinting and I-600A. My husband and I are in the process of 
adopting from the People's Republic of China. As is the case with many 
other waiting families, we will most likely need to redo our 
fingerprints and I-600A application. The fee increases place an 
additional financial burden on an already costly process. 

Please reconsider these fee increases. 

Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
Tara Maratea
