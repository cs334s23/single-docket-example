Subject: Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear OMB:  Good Afternoon,  Please vote down the 66% increase in application fees for international 
adoption.  Adoption (international and domestic) cost so much already that some wonderful people are not 
able to adopt.  I thought the basic intent of adoption is to place children who don't have a family with a 
loving family.  If this is still our intent, then why are we making it so hard for the average person who 
wants to adopt.  Please stop the increases so children around this world (and in America too) can be placed 
with loving families and the hope for a future.  For without hope what type of society are we.  Thank you 
for your consideration of this extremely important issue. 
Respectfully, 
Catherine J. Traino
