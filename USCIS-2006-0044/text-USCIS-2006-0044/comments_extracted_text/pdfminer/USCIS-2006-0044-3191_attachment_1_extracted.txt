Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Dear US Citizenship and Immigration Services 

My husband and I had our dossier log into the Peoples Republic of China on 
12/12/05 to adopt our daughter.  Because of the very long delays in 
processing dossiers in China, our documents expired and we had to complete 
a second I-600A Petition in which there was a rate increase.  Adoption is a 
wonder way to build families and provide homes for the homeless.  Please 
help families to continue to adopt by making sure the rates are controlled 
by the Federal Government. 

Sincerely, First time Mom 
Margaret Biggs
