Ref: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044    

I am writing to object to the vast increase in fees proposed for application for Residence and for 
application for Citizenship.   

I was born in the U. S. as were my Grandparents and some generations before of some of my 
Grandparents so this does not personally directly affect me.   

My wife was admitted to the U. S. as a Resident in 1964 and had already applied for 
Naturalization before we were married in 1970 and her application was completed and she was 
Naturalized in 1971.   

Her mother and younger sister also were admitted as Residents in 1964 and are Naturalized 
Citizens and her brothers and sisters also are Naturalized Citizens and none of  these fees 
personally directly affect us.   

I have lived near many immigrants from many countries for many years and have shopped in 
many immigrant owned stores.   

I consider immigrants to be an asset to our country and I feel that it is in our country's best 
interest as well as our citizen's best interest and immigrant's best interest for the fees not to have 
any vast increase in fees.   

Sincerely yours,
