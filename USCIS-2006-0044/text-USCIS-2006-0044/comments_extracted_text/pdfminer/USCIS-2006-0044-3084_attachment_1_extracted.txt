Subject: Comments regarding USCIS-2006-0044 

This is a comment to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and is in 
response to docket number USCIS-2006-0044 

Greetings, 

I am writing to strongly urge you to reconsider raising the fees associated with 
international adoptions (specifically, forms I-600, I-600A, N-600, N-565, and I-824).  
The fees are already financially burdensome, especially when one considers that most 
health care agencies cover the cost of much of prenatal care, making biological birth 
essentially cost-free.  In contrast, adoptions have cost my wife and I over $25,000 in fees, 
including those from USCIS.  In all likelihood, we will have to submit some of these 
USCIS forms twice or three times total (due to rapid expiration), so the cost of adoption 
has not ended. 

I understand the fee increase may reflect increases in costs at USCIS for processing, but 
much of the system to get approval seems designed to harm the applicants.  A 50% 
increase in fees is unwarranted without justification - it far exceeds any cost of inflation.  
Having been "in the process" of adoption for over a year, we have seen that the system is 
slow and cumbersome to all, and has not improved. 

I propose a counter suggestion.  Rather than increase the cost of processing the forms, 
reduce the number of forms or allow their expiry dates to be extended.  It would result in 
a decrease in your efforts, in the efforts of the adoptive parents, and would assure more 
speedy adoptions. 

Please contact me if you wish to discuss this issue. 

Kindest regards, 

Keith Maggert
