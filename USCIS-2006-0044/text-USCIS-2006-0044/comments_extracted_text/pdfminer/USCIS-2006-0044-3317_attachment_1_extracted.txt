Subject: Raised fees 

I just wanted to add our comments about raising the fees for adoption paperwork.  Since 
the majority of our stateside fees were to the government, it really bothers us with the 
kind of service that we received for those fees.   

We would suggest that BEFORE a fee adjustment (upward) is made, that consideration 
be made of raising the services and the professionalism that those services are 
administered be taken care of FIRST.  We were really bothered by the fact of having to 
involve a senator of our great state had to happen before services were taken seriously.   

It bothered us how unprofessionally we were treated in the Salt Lake City office, as 
compared to the government offices around the world (having been treated in Latvia as 
well as Poland, MUCH better than we were locally).  It really bothered us that WE spoke 
English, and simply needed paperwork filed for adoptions, and yet when we watched 
how immigrants were treated, we were bothered by their treatment as well.   

Anyway, that's our two cents' worth, but we feel that the charges are ALREADY too 
high, especially for the service that is rendered.  Why not consider lowering them 
instead????
