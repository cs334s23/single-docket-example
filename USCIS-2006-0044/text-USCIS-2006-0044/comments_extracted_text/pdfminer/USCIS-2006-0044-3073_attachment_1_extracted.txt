Subject: USCIS fees 

Dear Sir/Madam, 

I am writing to ask you to reconsider on the raising of fees for international adoption. It is 
already quite an expensive endeavor to adopt a child from overseas and a hindrance for 
families to consider given financial constraints. For the interest in the adoption process 
and welfare of the children, I feel that the fees should not be increase any further. 

Sincerely, 
Manish D. Assar, M.D.
