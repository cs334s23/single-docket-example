While I am sure that the costs of decreasing application times and opening new offices will 
increase, it does not seem as if we are encouraging new immigrants to try to become legal when 
the costs of applying almost double what they are now. 
I would plead with you to consider that many of these people are poor and struggling to survive 
on minimum wage or less.  Most of the American citizens grandparents or great or great great 
grandparents were immigrants once themselves. 
   Our undocumented immigrants pay millions of dollars in taxes; yet, many have had basic 
services which they need, like a driving license or health services taken away, so that makes it 
harder for them to obtain and keep a job in order to save for the application fee.  
    . Many  immigrants are very hard-working and law abiding and want to become citizens.  
We should make it easier for them to do so, not impossible. $300 might be more reasonable; 
even that is TOO MUCH!  
Do you want them to be contributing, tax-paying, law abiding citizens? Then, do not make it 5- 10 
years before they can qualify and also make it easier for them to find out what their status is at 
any given time and when they might reasonably expect to be considered for immigration. 
My understanding is that in Utah the office to get a green card is only open 8-5 and located in Salt 
Lake City. If this is true, then, it makes this almost impossible for a person to apply who is living 
outside the Wasatch Front unless he or she wants to lose their daily wage or job to do so.  WE 
NEED TO MAKE THIS APPLICATION EASIER.. so that people can comply and we can track 
them and support them in their goals of finding honest work and not make the whole process 
more restrictive or, in some cases, impossible for them to comply with the law!!  
  Please consider finding other resources than charging the poor immigrants more so that you can 
buy computers, train people, and open more offices.. a 10 year wait for approval of an 
immigration application is just plain ridiculous!!   cut down the wait time and open 1/2 of the 
offices and use some used or donated computers by business or private corporations. WE CAN 
DO BETTER  THAN THIS AS A NATION of HOPE of EQUITY and OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL.
