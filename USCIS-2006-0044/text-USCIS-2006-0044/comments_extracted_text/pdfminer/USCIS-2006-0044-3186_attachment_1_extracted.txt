Subject: USCIS-2006-0044-0001 

To whom it may concern, 

I represent no state or federal agency but file this 
comment as U.S. citizen 
residing in the state of Missouri in opposition of 
docket USCIS-2006-0044. 

My wife and I are currently persuing an international 
adoption and docket 
USCIS-2006- 0044 places undue financial contraints 
upon our adoption process. 

My wife and I applied for and recieved a I-600A form 
from USCIS at a cost of 
$695.00. This vital document in the adoption process 
expires after 15 months 
and then must be must be renewed. According to the 
Proposed Rule mentioned 
above, current processing time for an I-600A document 
is 3.39 months. 

The current 15 month period in which the I-600A 
document is valid simply does 
not work for citizens persuing internation adoption in 
the light that 
international adoptions, China in this case) are now 
taking 17 months. 
Obviously this is longer than the 15 months the I-600A 
document is valid. 

Now comes proposal, USCIS-2006- 0044, which will raise 
the fees associated for 
aquiring an I-600A document which places more more 
financial burdens on us in 
our adoption process. It's bad enough that the I-600A 
form cost $695, and even 
worse that the form is not valid thoughout the entire 
adoption process. 
Especially in the light that foreign countries can 
lengthen the waiting time for 
prospective couples to adopt children. 

USCIS-2006- 0044 aims at increasing the costs 
associated with our adoption 
process. While I understand the need to increase the 
cost, I am more opposed, 
because this proposal will increase the total outlay 
of fees I must pay by more 
than two fold. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you're going to increase the fees, please pass 
legislation that extends the 
life of the I-600A form beyond the current limitation 
of fifteen months and all 
those holding current I-600A forms to be grandfathered 
into the legislation. 
I-600A forms should be valid for the entire duration 
of the process for 
individuals persuing adoptions. 

Sincerely, 
Brad and Kim Beckenhauer
