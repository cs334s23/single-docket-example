Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Gentlepeople: 
    I urge you to reconsider the proposed increases of fees for both permanent and naturalization 
applications. They are very unfair for people who are coming to our shores, as almost all of our 
ancestors did, with very little money. They only want to better their lives, as immigrants have 
done so for the entire history of our nation. 
    USCIS should work with Congressional leaders to find alternative and permanent funding that 
supports their operations, instead of requiring poor people to accomplish this. 
    My prayers go with you.
