Subject: New proposed Fees 

This new fees are not affordable for many immigrants. I 
understand it is worth it, but I will say, if this new fee level 
will be approved,the number of some applications will drop 
drastically,for example Form I -130. As a new American 
citizen,me and my wife petitioned for  our parents and 
some of brothers & sisters, but if we had to pay for new 
proposed Fees, it would have been impossible financially to 
afford it. Do not forget most of people who wants to come 
in USA are from the poor countries.So, I like to say the 
workload of applications will be smaller,and i am afraid the 
budget will remain the same. 

   For some applications it is worth it to pay more 
money.like N-400, I-485. 

                                     Thanks
