Dear USCIS: 

I oppose the proposed application fee increases because of the negative 
impact it will have on our society. 

America is supposed to be an inclusive and embracing environment.  I feel 
that these fees will not the right message to those immigrants who are 
trying to stay or come to this country legally.  Aside from the negative 
message it send I also believe that these proposed fee increases will 
prevent immigrants who are legally trying to enter or stay in this country 
from applying.  Therefore, I think that it will lead to a higher rate of 
illegal immigrants within our communities which will, in turn, cause a 
bigger financial strain on its citizens. 

I hope that you will re-evaluate effects of these proposed application fee 
increases.  These fees will increase the strain that our communities already 
face due to the amount of illegal immigrants that we already support.  
Please do what is best for the citizens of this country. 

I believe that there are other ways that USCIS can offset its administrative 
costs, possibly by urging you to encourage the United States Government to 
contribute funds to UCSIS. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
