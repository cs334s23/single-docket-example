USCIS Comments 

Dear USCIS Comments: 

I am writing to you as an international educator in opposition to the 
February 1, 2007, proposed rule "Adjustment of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule."  The 
proposed fee increases are so exorbitant they will act as a disincentive 
for international students and scholars to study and work in the United 
States.  USCIS must reconsider the role of appropriated funds to meet the 
administrative needs of the agency.  I ask that fees be reduced to the 
actual cost of processing the application or petition.  

There are countless reasons that these increases should be opposed.  
International students and scholars, and campus officials that employ them 
will all be affected by these changes.  

On a personal note, I have many close friends would be directly affected 
by these changes.  Secondly, any action that the US takes to make it more 
difficult for foreign nations to be in the United States causes those same 
foreign nations to impose equally ridiculous changes to their policies.  
You don't think this is true?  I work with over 600 US students every year 
who apply for a visa to study in Europe.  In just the last three years I 
have seen a huge number of restrictions take place.  These are all a 
result of the changes that the US government has made. 

 Meanwhile, I ask Congress to step up to its responsibility for fixing the 
untenable situation that drives these fee increases. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. 

Sincerely, 

Alexis McKinley Jones
