Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am commenting on the benefit application fee schedule adjustment.  I do not think 
that these fees should be increased.  As a perspective adoptive parent of a child 
through intercountry adoption, I find the increase in fees to be excessive.  Often 
times we must pay for the renewal of our I-600a/I171h twice before we are able to 
adopt our child.  This becomes burdensome!  I don't think that any fees should be 
increased.  If we want people to follow the rules to become citizens of the United 
States, the costs can prohibit following this protocol and people are more apt to be 
illegal.  I do not think that any of the costs should be increased.
