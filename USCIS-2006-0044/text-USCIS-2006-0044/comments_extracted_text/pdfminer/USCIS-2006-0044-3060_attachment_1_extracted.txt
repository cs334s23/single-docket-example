Subject: USCIS-docket number 2006-0044: Please no more fees! 

To whom it may concern, 

It has been called to our attention that USCIS is proposing an increase of fees for much of the 
immigration paperwork needed to complete international adoption.    Please no more increased 
fees!   Adoption related expenses are already outrageous, and more fees from our own 
government are painful!  It is difficult not to wonder if the increase of these fees is due to the 
common conclusion that adoptive families are wealthy, upper middle class who elect to bring their 
children from foreign countries and therefore can afford to pay more!  We certainly feel that 
foreign entities believe this -- we hope our own country does not believe this as well! 

Please do not increase immigration fees!
