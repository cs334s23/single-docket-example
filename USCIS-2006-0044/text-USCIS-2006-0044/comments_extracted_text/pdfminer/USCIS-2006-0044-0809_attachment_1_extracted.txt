Subject: Fees 

I am totally in favor of the fee increases. 

But in addition, applicants should be charged 
$2500/yr., for every year they have been in 
the country illegally. 

There is a tremendous underground economy 
for these illegals.  Many are earning a lot of 
money working, "UNDER THE TABLE" and 
paying 0 taxes. 

Thank you, 
K. Penny
