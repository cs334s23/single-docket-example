Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

If the fees continue to rise and as we now have to resubmit all of them 
again due to the delays, it will cause us not to adopt another child. 
Please do your part by keeping the current prices and change the process 
that couples only have to pay them once during each adoption process. 
Young girls and seeking abortions daily and yet there are 25 couples per 
baby who are wanting to adopt.  The government is making it more difficult 
to adopt especially to those of us who have sought every avenue available. 
We have had 3 of relatives have been adopted and my secretary has 4 
adopted children.  The process was easier for them and now it seems to 
have gotten increasingly worse.  Help us and those who want to adopt, find 
a way to make the process easier and more affordable. 

Sincerely, 
Rev. David Chase
