Dear Director U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 

On behalf of my performing arts organization and the audiences 
we serve, I submit these comments in response to the proposed 
rule published in 72 Fed. Reg. 4888-4915 (February 1, 2007) to 
adjust the immigration and naturalization benefit application 
and petition fee schedule. 

It is a great idea to increase the filing fees for nonimmigrant 
worker petitions.  

I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on this proposed 
fee increase. We agree with the proposed fee increase. 
Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Chuck Liddell
