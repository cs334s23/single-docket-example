RE:  Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044:  Proposed  Fee Increase

Dear Director,

I am writing in response to the unprecedented  massive proposed fee increase for

immigration and citizenship  applications.  While fees of course  must be adjusted  from
time to time, the scope  of this proposed increase is completely out of  scale.

Moreover, the elimination of fee waivers for most applications  will create undue

hardship, particularly for vulnerable applicants such as battered  spouses  and children, and
asylees.  While I applaud the elimination of fees for the 1-360 (Battered  Spouse  Self-
Petition) and the continuing policy of not charging a fee for Form 1-589 (Asylum
Application), I question the sense of eliminating fee waivers across  the board for Form I-
485.  The complete elimination of access to a fee waiver for the 1-485 will put permanent
resident status out of reach for the very people you claim to be trying to help: survivors of
domestic violence and persecution.  I urge you to continue the current policy of allowing
fee waiver requests to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

I further  urge you to reconsider the scale of the fee increase,  and to consider
requesting supplemental appropriations from  Congress if you feel that operating expenses
are so far above revenue.

Thank ydu rejr your consideration.

Application),  I question the sense of eliminating fee waivers across the board for Form I-
485.  The complete elimination of access to a fee waiver for the 1-485 will put permanent
resident status out of reach for the very people you claim to be trying to help: survivors of
domestic violence and persecution.  I urge you to continue the current policy of allowing
fee waiver requests to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for most  applications.

I further urge you to reconsider the scale of the fee increase,  and to consider

are so far above revenue.

Thank you for your  consideration.

RE:  Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044:  Proposed Fee Increase

Dear Director,

I am writing in response to the unprecedented massive proposed fee increase for
immigration  and citizenship applications.  While fees of course must be adjusted  from

Dear Director,

I am writing in response to the unprecedented massive proposed  fee increase  for

immigration and citizenship applications.  While fees of course must be adjusted  from
time to time, the scope of this proposed increase is completely out of scale.

Moreover, the elimination of fee waivers for most applications  will create  undue

hardship,  particularly for vulnerable applicants such as battered spouses  and children, and
asylees.  While I applaud the elimination of fees for the 1-360 (Battered  Spouse  Self-
Petition) and the continuing policy of not charging a fee for Form 1-589 (Asylum
Application),  I question the sense of eliminating fee waivers across the board for Form I-
485.  The complete elimination of access to a fee waiver  for the 1-485 will put permanent
resident status out of reach for the very people you claim to be trying to help: survivors of
domestic violence  and persecution.  I urge you to continue the current policy of allowing
fee waiver requests to be evaluated on a case-by-case  basis for most applications.

I further urge you to reconsider the scale of the fee increase, and to  consider
requesting supplemental  appropriations from  Congress if you feel that operating  expenses
are so far above revenue.

Thank you for your consideration.

domestic violence  and persecution.  I urge you to continue the current policy of allowing
fee waiver requests to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for most  applications.

I further  urge you to reconsider the scale of the fee increase,  and to  consider
requesting supplemental  appropriations  from  Congress if you feel that operating  expenses
are so far above revenue.

Thank you for your consideration.

RE:  Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044:  Proposed Fee Increase

Dear Director,

I am writing in response to the unprecedented massive proposed fee increase for

immigration and citizenship applications.  While fees of course must be adjusted  from
time to time, the scope of this proposed increase is completely out of scale.

Moreover, the elimination of fee waivers for most applications will create undue

hardship, particularly for vulnerable applicants such as battered spouses and children, and
asylees.  While I applaud the elimination of fees for the 1-360 (Battered  Spouse Self-
Petition) and the continuing policy of not charging a fee for Form 1-589 (Asylum
Application), I question the sense of eliminating fee waivers across the board for Form I-
485.  The complete elimination of access to a fee waiver for the 1-485 will put permanent
resident status out of reach for the very people you claim to be trying to help: survivors of
domestic violence and persecution.  I urge you to continue the current policy of  allowing
fee waiver requests to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for most  applications.

I further urge you to reconsider the scale of the fee increase, and to  consider
requesting supplemental  appropriations from  Congress if you feel that operating expenses
are so far above revenue.

Thank you for your consideration.
