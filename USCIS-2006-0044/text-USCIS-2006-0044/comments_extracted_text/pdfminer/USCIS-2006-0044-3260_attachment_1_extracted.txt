Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

As U.S. citizens and prospective parents of an orphan from China, we are 
 writing regarding current USCIS regulations that affect the 
process and cost of China adoption. 

As part of the extensive adoption process, we are required to obtain 
USCIS approval (form I-171H/I-797C). According to current USCIS 
regulations, this approval is valid for 18 months. However, due to the 
lengthy wait to be matched with a child from China, it is a certainty 
that every family who has a dossier in China will experience the 
expiration of their (1) fingerprints (valid for 15 months) and (2) 
I-171H/I-797C approval (valid for 18 months). The cost to adoptive 
families of filing a new I-600A (Advance Petition to Adopt an Orphan) 
will be very high, both emotionally and financially. The cost to USCIS 
offices of processing new I-600As will be also be very high, in terms 
of time and resources. 

We urge you to support the following recommendations: 

1) Effective immediately, increase the valid period for all newly 
issued I-171H/I-797C from 18 to 24 months 
2) Effective immediately, allow all families holding a valid 
I-171H/I-797C to file and be approved for an extension to 24 months 
within 30 days after submitting the following documents: 
a. A copy of their current I-171H/I-797C and valid fingerprints 
b. A Home Study update to ensure that families still qualify to adopt 
from China 
3) Do not increase USCIS adoption-related fees 

This is important because the burden of paying for and submitting a 
new I-600A for a file that is already approved seems to be a frivolous 
and poor use of USCIS resources. The cost to families is up to $2,000 
and it seems that USCIS offices already face heavy caseloads.  

Please say no to proposed USCIS cost increases and yes to extending 
the term for I-171 validity to 24 months. 

Thank you for your consideration.
