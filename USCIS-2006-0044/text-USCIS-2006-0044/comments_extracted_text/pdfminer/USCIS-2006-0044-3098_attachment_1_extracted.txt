Below is a  statement I fervently agree with and desire anyone making decisions on 
increasing fees to read... 

Thank you

If one wants to change the name on a Social Security Card, the cost is FREE. 

To change your name on a driver’s license (in WA State) the cost is $10 

To change a name on a Passport (within one year of issuance) the cost is FREE. 

To change a name on the Certificate of Citizenship – the only document that satifies all 
requirements for proving US citizenship; a document only issued to foreign born US 
citizens — the cost is $380… 

This *huge* discrepency shows clear discrimination against our children. How can it 
possibly cost almost $400 to print a piece of paper? Our kids are American citizens… and 
we are taxpayers. If anything, USCIS should be lowering the cost not raising it by $160!

This same type of discrimination is being played out in the I600a and fingerprinting fees. 
Probably half of all international adoptions these days take two years from start to finish. 
With the I600a expiring in 18 months and the fingerprints expiring after only 15 months, 
that means many PAP’s will have to pay those fees twice. That means it’s not $125 
increase for the I600a, but really a $250 increase. And the fingerprints will cost people 
$160, not just $80. (the whole re-fingerprinting makes no sense to me to begin with, but 
that’s another issue, I suppose). The result of these exhorbatant fees is the USCIS is in 
essence pressuring prospective adopters to chose the “faster” programs over those that 
may be more established and stable. And why should people be punished just because 
they have a longer wait?
