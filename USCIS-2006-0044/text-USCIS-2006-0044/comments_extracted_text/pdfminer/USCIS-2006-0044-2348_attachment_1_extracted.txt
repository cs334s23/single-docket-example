Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Financial exploitation of the people who seek to adopt internationally is a backdoor way to stop 
international adoption by the US government.  Do not raise fees for Immigration benefits.  Focus 
immigration control on the millions of ILLEGAL immigrants in the US, not on the families that can 
adopt!
