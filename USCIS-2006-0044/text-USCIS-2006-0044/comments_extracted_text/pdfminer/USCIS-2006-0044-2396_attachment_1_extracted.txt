Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS -2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 
I am writing to express my outrage over the proposed fee increases for legal residency 
and naturalization as well as the other barriers (longer applications, electronic filing 
requirements, still more fees). This affects an extraordinary number of our members---
especially those working in nursing homes and packing houses. Why should we punish 
some of our hardest working community members who are already struggling in so many 
ways? 
I am also a Lutheran pastor at Christ Lutheran Church on Capitol Hill. My congregation 
is full of Liberian, Eritrean and Cambodian members who also will be impacted by these 
changes. It’s difficult to see how this is not just another move by our current 
administration to shift costs to those least empowered to fight it. Let’s find a more just 
way to find our immigration services!!!
