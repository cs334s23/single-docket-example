I understand the need to raise fees for immigration services, however, I believe a reduction or 
exemption should be made for foreign children who are being adopted by US citizens. 

The adopted children are minors, they are not security threats and should not require the same 
level of scrutiny as adult immigrants.   

In addition, the adoptive parents are US citizens - not foreign nationals.  As such they should be 
entitled a reduction/exemption from what you charge foreign nationals. 

Thank you for your consideration.
