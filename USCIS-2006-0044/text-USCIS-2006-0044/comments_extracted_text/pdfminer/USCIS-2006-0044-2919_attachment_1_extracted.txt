USCIS-2006-0044 

Families who are trying to adoption children have a long list of 
requirements to meet besides the huge costs involved. 
I am writing to encourage our government not to increase the fees to adopt 
children, 
saddling families with even higher costs. 
People who are adopting children are providing homes to kids who may not get 
a chance 
and we should do more to help these familes rather than putting more road 
blocks in their way. 

LET'S HELP CHILDREN GET ADOPTED 
STOP THE INCREASES IN COST
