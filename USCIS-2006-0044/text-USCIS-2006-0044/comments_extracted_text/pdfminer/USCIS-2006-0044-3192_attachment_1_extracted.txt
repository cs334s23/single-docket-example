Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

An adoption is a lengthy stressful process, with that said it is also worth all the stress financial, 
emotional, and physical.  As an adoptive parent I know first hand the cost and all though it is 
worth every penny please remember the children.  They deserve loving mothers and fathers and 
with each additional increase in fees you may be making a hardship for a family that is desperate 
to bring their child home.  Please consider not increases the fees nothing is more important than 
the life of a child donâ€™t make it more difficult. 

Respectfully Yours,
