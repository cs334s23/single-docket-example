Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Dear sirs:  
Our daughter is presently in the process of adopting a baby from China. She brought it to our attention that 
application fee is about to be increased. This process is already very expensive and to increase the fee will 
only limit the number of people who will become parents of these abandoned children. Please reconsider 
this and leave the fees as they are .
