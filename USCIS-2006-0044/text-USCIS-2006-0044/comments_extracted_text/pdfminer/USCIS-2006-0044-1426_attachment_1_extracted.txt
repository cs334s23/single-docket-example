Dear DHS, 

I am a faculty member in the Geography department at Penn State 
University. I think 
this proposed fee increase is a terrible idea! It will negatively 
impact the research 
efforts of the GeoVISTA Center. We depend on foreign students to do 
much of the programming work, and this change will scare many 
potentially excellent applicants off. We operate within a global 
marketplace for education, and changes like this make us less 
competitive.
