 Director, Regulatory Management Division: 

Dear Sir or Madam: 

I have been practicing immigration law for twenty-five years.  I am 
shocked and dismayed to see the dramatic proposals for increases in filing 
fees. If these increases go into effect, many individuals who have 
diligently obeyed the U.S. immigration laws and qualified for immigration 
benefits may be unable to pay the filing fees.  With the proposed fee of 
$905 for an adjustment case, adjustment applicants will essentially be 
required to pay for benefits (work card or advance parole) which they may 
not even want or need.  For many families, the increased costs could make 
the "green card" unattainable. 

Raising immigration filing fees to a level which could exclude many people 
from the immigration process is both unconscionable and contrary to 
longstanding U.S. immigration policy.  

Sincerely, 

Kathy Goss
