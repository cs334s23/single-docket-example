This proposal would be very negative to US arts organizations who regularly attempt to schedule 
foreign artists in their seasons.  The federal government is annually attempting to cut or not 
increase the budget for support of the arts in America so how are organizations to meet the new 
costs required by this proposal.  Steps should be taken to make visas for foreign artists easier 
and cheaper to obtain, not more expensive.
