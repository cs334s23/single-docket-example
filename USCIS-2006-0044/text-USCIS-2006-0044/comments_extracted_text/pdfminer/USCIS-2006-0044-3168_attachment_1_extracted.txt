Emilio Gonzalez 
USCIS Director 

Dear Emilio Gonzalez: 

I oppose the plan of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to 
raise the costs of applying for American citizenship so drastically. 

It is important to allow immigrants the affordable chance to become 
citizens. This is an example of the federal government being }penny wise 
and pound foolish." Let's find the money from another source not on the 
backs of the people applying to be citizens. 

USCIS is one of the few government agencies that operates primarily on 
user fees, yet it plans to put an additional burden on people already 
working as hard as possible to become lawful U.S. citizens. Naturalization 
for a family of four would rise to $2,430. 

Congress should appropriate the funds necessary to allow thousands of 
hard-working immigrants to gain citizenship at a cost they can afford and 
USCIS should absolutely not enact these dramatic increases. 

Sincerely, 

Doug and Karen Seidman
