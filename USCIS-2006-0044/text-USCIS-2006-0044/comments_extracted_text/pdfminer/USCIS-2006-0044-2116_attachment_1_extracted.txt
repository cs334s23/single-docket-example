Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 re increase in O-1 processing fee 

The Van Cliburn Foundation is best known for presenting the Van Cliburn International Piano 
Competition, one of America's most prestigious cultural events on a quadrennial basis.  It is my 
privilege and responsibility to coordinate U.S. tours for the outstanding young artists awarded as 
winner of each competition for the three years following each event.  Assisting the Foundation's 
efforts to launch the careers of these often foreign-born artists are television documentaries, 
internet and radio programs and commercial record distributors along with hundreds of non-profit 
concert and orchestra presenters interested in bringing the best talent of a new generation to their 
audiences.  In light of the proposed increase in filing fees toward O-1 visas for touring artists, why 
would our government want to create additional hurdles for the many deserving young 
artists to connect with American audiences when it allows for so many 
programs/auspices/attitudes that support what we do?   And from the other perspective, why 
should concert-attenders be denied the opportunity to experience the best young talents of a 
generation - many of whom cannot be guaranteed enough income from concert engagements to 
cover increased travel costs -  because our government seems not to be able to find a way to 
process paperwork (even for the many who have toured here on a regular basis) efficiently 
without undue harm to the recipient? 

PLEASE DO NOT FURTHER INCREASE THE INCREASING POSSIBILITY THAT FOREIGN-
BORN ARTISTS WILL LOSE INTEREST/HOPE IN SHARING THEIR TALENTS WITH 
AMERICAN AUDIENCES - ultimately eroding the base for our existences as well as that for 
many of our esteemed colleagues. 

Thank you,
