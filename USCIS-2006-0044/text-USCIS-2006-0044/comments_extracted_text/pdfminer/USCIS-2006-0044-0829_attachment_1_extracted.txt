comments on DHS Docket No. USCIS-006-0044: 
I support the fee increase. My estimated cost of immigrantion will be around $5000 and 
majority goes to lawyer's pocket. If the service can be faster and easier, lawyers will 
make else but the process for us will be much faster.  
It is reasonable to have immigrants pay for our own service.
