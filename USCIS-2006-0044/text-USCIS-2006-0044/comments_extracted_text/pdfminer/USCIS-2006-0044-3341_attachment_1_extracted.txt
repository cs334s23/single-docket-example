Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 - Adoptive Parent 

Greetings- 
I am writing to express my deep concern about the pending increase in 
USCIS fees for adoption-related petitions. I am in the process of 
adopting from China, and given that the wait time has slowed down 
considerably, it is likely that both my I-171H and fingerprints will 
expire before I receive a referral. That means I will have to pay twice 
for the I600A and fingerprints, plus the increases in fees for N565 
(name changes) and N600 (Certificate of Citizenship). I understand that 
costs go up, but ask you to consider reducing the fee for second 
applications for the I600A, and maintaining the current fees for the 
others. 

International adoption is an expensive undertaking, and these proposed 
increases will add to the financial burden for many, many families. 

Thank you very much. 

Sincerely, 
Cory Munson
