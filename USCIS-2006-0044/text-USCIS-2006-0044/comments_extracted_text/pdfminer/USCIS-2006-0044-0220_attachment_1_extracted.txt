The increases appear to be quite drastic and beyound many honest  hard working immigrants who desire 
the same dreams many of out forefathers had. Perhaps the intent is making the land of immigrants so 
inhospitable with walls, block list, profiling, and an anxiety filled (now more costly) maze, so as to close 
our doors completely to those seeking the American Dream. Lady Liberty might as well fold her 
welcoming arms and go fishing! She can leave a sign in her stead, "Your kind not welcomed here no 
more!!"
