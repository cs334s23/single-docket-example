RE:  DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044
Proposed rule— Adjustment  of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Application and
Petition Fee Schedule

Dear Director:

As residents of the state of Washington, we are writing to convey our concern about the
proposed increase in fees for the N-400 citizenship application and fees  from  $400 to $675.  We
believe that the increase of $275 (from the already high cost of $400) will make citizenship for
many low-income immigrants and refugees close to impossible.

We, the individuals signed below, would like to request that USCIS asks congress for additional
money instead of asking individuals to shoulder the additional costs.

Please reconsider your proposed fee increase.

Sincerely,

March 14, 2007
