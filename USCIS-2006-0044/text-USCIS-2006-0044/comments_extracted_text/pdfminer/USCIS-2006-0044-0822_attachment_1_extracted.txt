Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear Sir or Madam: 

Regarding the proposed fees for CIS forms (CIS No. 2393-06; Docket No. 
USCIS-2006-0044), while I understand that it is necessary to have fees 
line up with the costs for processing forms and applications, I am 
concerned that the validity periods for I-600/I-600A forms are too short 
for many adoptions to be completed without having to redo or update these 
forms.  Please increase the periods of validity for the I-600/I-600A 
forms so that both the workload of CIS and the burden on adoptive parents 
is minimized. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, 
Cindy Brent
