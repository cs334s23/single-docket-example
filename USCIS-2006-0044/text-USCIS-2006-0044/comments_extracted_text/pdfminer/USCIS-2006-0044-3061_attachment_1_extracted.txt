RE: Docket Number USCIS-2006-0044 

To whom it may concern, 

It is my understanding that the USCIS intends to raise their fees for Forms I600/600A, N565, 
N600, and I824. All of these forms are associated with the adoption process. As a mother in the 
process of adopting twins, I can contest that the current fees are already quite steep and I am 
opposed to further fee increases. Although I felt I had saved substantially for the adoption 
process ($15000), I have already ran through this savings and the boys are nowhere near to 
coming home yet. Increasing your fees will simply increase this financial burden on an already 
expensive and emotionally wrenching process. 

Again, I am opposed to the increase of fee for Forms I600/600A, N565, N600, and I824. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me, 

Sincerely, 

Suzanne Eckert
