Subject: No immigration fee increases 
I am writing to protest the proposed increases in fees at the USCIS. To raise the 
application fee for citizenship from $330 to $595 and the fee for becoming a legal 
permanent resident from $325 to $905 is excessive and constitutes bias against those 
immigrants who do not have substantial financial reserves. 
I agree fully with San Francisco immigration attorney Marc Van Der Hout who has stated 
that after the breakup of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service last March, 
"We thought we would have a more efficient and friendlier immigration services, but that 
has not turned out to be true. [Instead] almost all the money is going to enforcement, and 
services are being ignored. It makes no sense to fund all this through filing fees."  
I also agree fully with the statement by a spokeswoman for the American Immigration 
Lawyers Association who urged Eduardo Aguirre, director of the U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Service, to "demonstrate good faith by forswearing the fee increase until the 
pandemic backlogs throughout the agency are noticeably decreased." 
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on 
immigration, border security and citizenship, is absolutely right to criticize the hefty fee 
hikes, saying they would "price the American Dream out of reach for qualified 
immigrants" seeking to become citizens.  
As one who has suffered through the overly long waiting periods of the current 
immigration system and paid the already exorbitant fees, I cannot support the proposed 
increases. They are excessive and place too great a burden on poorer immigrants. 
No to fee increases. 
Sincerely, 
Erica Arborea
