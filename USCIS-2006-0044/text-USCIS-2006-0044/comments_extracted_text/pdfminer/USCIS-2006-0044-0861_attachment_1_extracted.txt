Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Hi, 

As a long waiting immigrats (since 1998 and still pending), I support the fee 
increase, but I have following comments. 

1. People should not have to pay for any extensions or renewals of the EAD cards or 
Advance Parole. The fee's should be only one time for initial application. This is only 
fair, as the people having to extend/renew these are not at fault and are actually 
suffering, and some peoples case could be pending for years for no-know reason. 
2. USCIS should have set time for processing all applications and this cannot be 
changed based on workload or other excuses.  
3. Anytime any of the applications are not adjudicated in the above time for no good 
reason, USCIS should have to refund the money for application 
4. Some people are stuck in Name check process for over 4 years. This is a totally 
opaque process, with no accountability. A portion of the revenue from the fee hikes 
should be used to improve services of FBI specifically for immigration related name 
check.. No application, should take longer than 1 month for clearance. Again 
accountability and fines for poor performance need to be put in place to ensure 
compliance. Applicants should be able to inquire regarding status of their 
namecheck. 
5. An audit of USCIS services should be done after 1 or 2 years of these fee hikes 
being put in effect to see if it has the impact that it is intended to. If not, the Director 
should have to answer to a Congressional inquiry, and the fee hike rescinded. 
6. A premium process similar to I-140 premium process should be installed at I-485 
applications.
