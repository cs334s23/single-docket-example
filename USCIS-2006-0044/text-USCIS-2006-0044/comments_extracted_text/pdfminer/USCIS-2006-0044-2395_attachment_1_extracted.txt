Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Just my comments on the proposed raising of fees for USCIS.  I am against the raising of the fee 
for USCIS.  We are currently involved in an international adoption.  With the time limitations of the 
I171H, we will have to renew our application before our adoption is complete.  With the wait times 
becoming longer, this is not only a one time fee but will need to be paid twice.  This just adds to 
the $20,000 to $25,000 fees we are already paying. 

Thank you,  

H. Franks
