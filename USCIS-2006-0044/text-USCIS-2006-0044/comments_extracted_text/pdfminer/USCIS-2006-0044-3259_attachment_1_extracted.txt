Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Please reconsider increasing these fees.  These increases, while  
seemingly small, may contribute to families choosing not to adopt  
internationally.  Children waiting to find homes may find they are  
not adopted due to a decrease in the already limited number of  
families who can afford adoption. 

Thank you,
