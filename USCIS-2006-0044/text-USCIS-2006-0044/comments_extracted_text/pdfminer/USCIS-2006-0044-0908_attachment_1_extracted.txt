4915]; Immigration: Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Dear USCIS: 

In reviewing the proposed fee schedule, I notice that the agency did 
not take into consideration the fact that now all I-130 visa 
applications have to go through the less efficient US offices.  With 
the changes from the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act to all 
ages of I-130 applicant beneficiaries, can no longer submit our 
applications at US consulates even if we are residing outside of the 
US.   

As noted in your assessment, 85% of the I-130 applications are 
adjudicated in agency locations.  I also know that until the rule 
change the expected wait in Japan 2.5 months instead of the 6+ months 
at your US offices.  The plan for raising fees shows no efforts to 
address this increase in volume to your US offices.  It would be 
acceptable to raise rates if the service was expected to improve, but 
the USCIS does not expect to show improvement in the immediate future 
without even taking into account the changes in I-130 processing 
locations.   

I am very disappointed in the sudden changes required by the Adam Walsh 
Child Protection and Safety Act to the I-130 processing and even more 
disappointed in the USCIS' failure to address this huge issue. 

Thanks, 

Theresa Yoshioka
