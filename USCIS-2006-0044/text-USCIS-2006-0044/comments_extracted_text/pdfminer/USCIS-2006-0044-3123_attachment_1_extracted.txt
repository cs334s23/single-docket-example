  It is inconcivible that the goverment would increase the fees for the services related to 
adoption. Fees should be totaly subsidised as adoption is a public service being 
performed by the people willing to take on the responsibilities nof parents.  
The government should make adoption easier as it actually decreases the requirement for 
public assistance for these children.
