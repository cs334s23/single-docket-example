Subject: [Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044];[ Immigration: Benefit 
application fee schedule adjustment 

As a hopeful, future, adoptive parent, this fee schedule increase will 
impact my husband and I severely.  We have already waited over 
17 months for our adoption to go through from China, and now we have to 
re-do all of our paperwork, including this one.  PLEASE PLEASE do not 
raise the cost of this; our adoption is what we are living for, and 
this creates another hardship for us.
