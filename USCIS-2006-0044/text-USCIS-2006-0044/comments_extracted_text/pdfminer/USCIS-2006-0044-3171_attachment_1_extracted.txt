Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am quite concerned about the Proposed Rule by the USCIS to increase international adoption 
fees.  As a parent in the international adoption process, it is already very expensive to adopt.  For 
some, the fees seem insurmountable.  Some people even shy away from adoption because of 
the already high costs.  Please do not pass this proposed rule. 

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 

Carey Borchers
