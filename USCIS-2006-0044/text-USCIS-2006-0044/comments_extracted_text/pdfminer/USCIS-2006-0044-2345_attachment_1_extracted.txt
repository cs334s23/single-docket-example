Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

This fee shifts the burden of government onto persons who, for whatever reasoning, have taken 
on the task of adopting a child.  The fees for adoption are significant already.  I feel the amount of 
this fee increase is unreasonable.  Something not taken into account is the fact that because 
adoption is often a lengthy process, most families must re-apply to the USCIS for renewal of their 
paperwork before finalizing the adoption process.  We must pay the fees twice.  Right now that 
amounts to $1,090.00.  With the new increase, the cost would be $1,340.00. There is no credit 
given for fees already paid, not to mention the fees for fingerprinting, documentation required, 
etc.  It is completely unreasonable to shift the financial burden of asluym and immigration fees for 
indigents to American citizens trying to have a family.
