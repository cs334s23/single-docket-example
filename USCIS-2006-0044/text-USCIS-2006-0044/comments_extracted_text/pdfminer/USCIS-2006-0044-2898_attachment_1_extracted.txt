Mr. Chertoff, 

1 am writing to express my concerns after reviewing the proposed rule regarding tbe adjustment of 

immigration and naturalization benefit application and petition fee schedule. 

The introductory summary states '%is  rule proposes to increase the immigration and naturalization 

benefit applications and petition fee schcdulc by wwcightcd as of $174."  However, the increases for oft- 

used forms are significantly more and immediate, 1 specifically note, tl~c 1-129F with a $285 (168%) 
increase and the I485 with a $580 (178%) increase.  J wonder whether these incrtascs arc indir~ctly m 
attempt to discourape immigration to the IJS7 

Within the detailed explanation, much ofthe fee increase is attributnbls to increased homeland security. 

However, an it should, much of the protection of our borders occurs at the overseas consulates.  Those are 

staffed and managed by the Bureau oPConsular Affairs arm of the State Department. The preuidential 

mandate of FY 2002 h a  pushed more work to the consulates. No new funding is proposed for the 

consulates. 

J bring to your attention the Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic consulate which has an 18 - 24 month 
backlog for fiance and spouse visas. Tliese are visas arc supposedly issued without a quom however 
citizens a p p l y ~ ~ g  

lor thcir fianceslapvusos arc in a line of 28000 people.  including non-citizens 

(permanent residents) applying for their family members. 

Onc ofthc ronsons given for the incrcase in 1-485 fces is duc ta the consolidation of 1-485 pieces. 

Nonetheless, advanced (travel) parole is an optional need.  Also, employment authorization is 
consolidated.  Further, based on recent conversatioxls with otliers, emplnyment authorizations arc not 

currently processed in a timely manner to be useful to applicants.

Another reason given for the  "...fee inorease is due to ttu~afnid increase in completion rates ..." It is not 
reasonable that because more people are applying for an adjustment of status is a reason to increase tlie 
fees  by  178%.  Increased applicants already result in increased tee collections. 

I request that you reconsider the need to sigrlificantly increase these fees at one time.  Another idea would 
be to phase in these incremes over a few years.
