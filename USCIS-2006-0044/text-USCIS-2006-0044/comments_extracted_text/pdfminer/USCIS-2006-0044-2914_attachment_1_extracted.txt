Subject: [Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044];[FR Doc: E7-01631];[Page 4887-4915]; Immigration: 
Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am writing to oppose the proposed increase in fees for the  
I-600/600A orphan petitions required of adoptive families. 

The cost of these petitions have already increased far out of  
proportion to any reasonable measures and a further increase will put  
an inordinate burden on adoptive parents. 

To attribute these increases to a need to increase security or  
administering our immigration laws strains credulity.  Infants and  
small children are not security risks. 

Please reject the proposed fee increases and extending the period  
where the I-171H is valid from 18 months to three years.
