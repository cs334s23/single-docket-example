Subject: Fee Increase 

Dear CIS: 
I oppose to the fee increase for "adoption". It already costs a family $20,000 to adopt a 
child. Adoption is a win, win, win situation. Let's make it not too difficult for the 
adoptive parents. I also like our government to extend the paperwork so that it will be 
good through the adoption process which is about 2 years now to save time and money 
for the adoptive parents. 
Thank you. 
Caroline Lau
