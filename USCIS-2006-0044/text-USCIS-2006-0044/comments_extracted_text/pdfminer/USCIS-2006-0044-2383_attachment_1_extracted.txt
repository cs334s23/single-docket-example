The proposed increase in fees for ADOPTION should NOT be executed.  Adoption is 
already very expensive and taxing on the parents.  For adoption, where children 
are assimilated into our culture quickly, the fees should be reduced. 

If you want to increase fees, do so for ADULT immigrants.  If you need $$, start 
prosecuting businesses that hire ILLEGAL immigrants.  The laws are already 
there! 

Please do NOT increase any fees related specifically to adoption!
