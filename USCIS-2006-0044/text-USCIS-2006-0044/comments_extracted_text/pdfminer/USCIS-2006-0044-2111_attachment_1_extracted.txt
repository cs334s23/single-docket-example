Hello, 
I am very concerned about the hike in naturalization fees that are being planned. I work 
with refugees with very limited income and the hike would create a significant  financial 
burden especially when you consider that the fee increase will be multiplied by the 
number of family members. The increase could make applying for citizenship 
prohibitive. 
 I am sure that the initial intent of this increase in fees is to raise funds for improvements, 
but what it actually does is contribute to making citizenship in this country a privilege of 
the rich. When we as a nation make a commitment to allow refugees to make our country 
theirs, I believe we have an obligation to make citizenship accessible regardless of one's 
financial standing. Please consider leaving the fees as they are or , if not, creating a 
waiver or discount specifically for low income people eligible otherwise for citizenship. 
Thank you, 
L. Zeidan
