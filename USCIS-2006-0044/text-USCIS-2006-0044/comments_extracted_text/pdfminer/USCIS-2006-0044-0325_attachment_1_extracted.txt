Subject: Comments on DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

The I-290B fee and Motions fee of $585 and N-336 fee of $605 unfairly penalize applicants for the USCIS's 
mistakes, because, in most cases seen by my law firm, "Service Error" causes the need for these 
appeals/motions.  The costs of "Service Errors" should not get placed on the backs of those wronged by 
incompetent application of the law.  In all cases where legal or factual error causes the need for the 
appeal, the applicant should have the ability to cite the legal or factual error and waive the fee or pay only 
a nominal fee.  In many cases, it appears that officers misinterpret the laws due to a  lack of 
comprehension and/or negligently fail to check for such things as changed addresses or representation by 
counsel when issuing appointment notices.  The cost of correcting such errors should fall upon the Service 
itself not the applicant. 

N-600/N-600K fee of $460 appears wholly excessive; a secure passport upon which one may travel costs 
less than $100.  Why would any one pay $460 to get proof of their United States Citizenship when they 
can get a passport for less than $100?  Remember, N-600 applicants just want documentary evidence of 
the status they already have, they do not apply for any benefit or status.  The N-600 fee should not cost 
more than what it costs to get a passport.
