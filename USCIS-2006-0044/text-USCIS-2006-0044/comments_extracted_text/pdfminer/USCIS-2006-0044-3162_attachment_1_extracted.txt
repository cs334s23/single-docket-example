Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am opposed to any increase in fees for parents adopting internationaly. 
Especially considering the fact that some adoptions, for instance China, 
parents have to "redo" the CIS I600A because the time frame for the document 
is so short (18 months) that one can not complete an adoption in China in 
that time frame. Parents also have to redo fingerprints since expiration is 
so soon. 
Sincerely 
Cynthia Rhoades
