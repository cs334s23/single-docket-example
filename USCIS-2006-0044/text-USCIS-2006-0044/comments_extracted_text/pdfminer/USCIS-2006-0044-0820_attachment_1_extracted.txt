Subject: Comment on USCIS new fee proposal USCIS-2006-0044 

To: Director, Regulatory Management Division, 
USCIS, Department of Homeland Security, 
111 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, 3rd Floor 
Washington, DC 20529 

Dear Sir/Madam: 
I am writing this letter to comment on USCIS new fee proposal.  

I am strongly against the fee increasing unless an independent audit can prove the 
following USCIS claim: “USCIS has already substantially improved service levels, 
achieving the President’s goal of six months processing times for immigration 
applications in October of 2006”. I also strongly request USCIS to set time line for 
FBI name check completion.  

I am a victim of USCIS inefficiency. I applied for my and my spouse adjustment of 
status petition (I485 Green card petition) with USCIS Texas service center on Apr 17 
2006. My case is pending for ten months.  In response to my case status inquiry, 
USCIS told me that our application will be pending indefinitely because of FBI name 
check delay.   

USCIS uses background check delay to mask their inefficiency. By doing this, USCIS 
threats national security because it will allow terrorists if any to stay longer in USA. 
 In the new fee proposal, USCIS only providing $12.4 million additional funds to FBI 
name check service, but no time line is given about FBI name check completion.
