To whom it may concern: 

I am writing this letter to express my concern over the proposed docket.  I am opposed to 
this docket and feel that the prices should not be raised for the adoption of 
international/domestic children.  Adoption fees are highly expensive as it is and raising 
the prices could cause some children not being placed into permanent loving homes.   

I am personally outraged that this is even a consideration.  I have had to scrap, save, and 
work extra hours at work to personally afford the adoption of my child which I am 
currently trying to adopt.  Raises the prices will only make it more difficult for me and 
thousands of others families who I know are in the adoption process.  I would appreciate 
your reconsideration of this docket.  

Sincerely,  
Leslie Cornett
