To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing to express my concern over the proposed increase in adoption-related fees currently 
being considered: 

Form 
Petition Type 
Current  
Fee 
Proposed  
Fee 

I-600/600A 
Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative 
$ 545 
$ 670 

N-565 
Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship (used for  
name changes) 
$ 220 
$ 380 

N-600 
Application for Certificate of Citizenship 
$ 255 
$ 460 

Biometric Services (fingerprints) 
$ 70 
$ 80 

As someone who has twice completed foreign-child adoptions, I can tell you that the hurdles are 
significant.  The combined requirements of both the U.S. and foreign governments result in 
months of paperwork and significant fees, several of which have little benefit.  For example, while 
fingerprints never change, most families have to do them twice (and pay for them twice), because 
they “expire”.   Background checks occur at several levels because the United States and foreign 
government requirements are slightly different. 

The combined fees are already insurmountable for many families and it would be a tremendous 
dis-service to the public to make a difficult process even more difficult.  If costs are outpacing 
revenue I encourage you to do what the private sector does – streamline processes and utilize 
technology to increase efficiency and reduce costs.
