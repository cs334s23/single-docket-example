Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

You have got to be kidding me!!! 
The average immigrant who worked so hard to get here and establish himself will not be able to 
afford to bring his family ! 
If the USCIS really wants to make money then reinstate the 245I and bump that fee--the illegals 
will pay that one !!! 
Doesn't the US want the illegals to pay taxes, etc????  
These new fees just puts legal immigration out of reach of the average person!
