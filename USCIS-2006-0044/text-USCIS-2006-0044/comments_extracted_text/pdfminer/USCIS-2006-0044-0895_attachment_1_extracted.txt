Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am sadden to see such a proposed increase in citizenship, fingerprinting, 1600a, etc.  Speaking 
from the standpoint of adoption, it is difficult enough to have to come up with the expenses to 
adopt without increasing such fees.  It will also just deter others from getting their citizenship.  
Please reconsider such a proposition. 
Thank you, 

Rhonda Probst
