Immigration: Benefit application fees 

To whom it may concern: 

I am opposed to raising the filing and biometrics fees as proposed in USCIS-2006- 0044.  
THis measure imposes an additional barrier to international adoption, which is expensive 
and challenging enough already.  International adoption benefits American families who 
might not have been able to build a family otherwise.  It also helps to alleviate the effects 
of poverty to some extent.  THere many arguments that could be made on a policy level, 
but most importantly, international adoption can literally save the life of a child; to that 
child, such as my son or my daughter, it is the best thing that could ever have happened.   

Both my children were living in orphanages without ever having experienced the love 
and guidance of a parent.  They were school-aged by the time I met them, with 
infinitesimally slight chances of ever having a family.  I was their only chance, and they 
were extremely lucky.   

But it was a great financial hardship, not to mention the mountains of paperwork, to make 
that adoptive journey.  Every dollar that I had to spend on adoption fees, governmental 
fees, travel expenses, in-country fees and expenses is that much less that I now have to 
spend in their growing-up years.  Taking inflation and the time value of money into 
account, those costs have eaten deeply into any funds for their education.   

Please have compassion for the kind-hearted people who go through such a difficult 
process, determined to open their hearts and homes to the children of the developing 
world.  Don't raise the fees any higher than they are. 

THank you, sincerely,
