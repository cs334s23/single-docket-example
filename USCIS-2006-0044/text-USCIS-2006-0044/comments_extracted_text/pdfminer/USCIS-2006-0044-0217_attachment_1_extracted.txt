Subject: Comments on Fee changes 2007 

Well, I generally fine with the fee increase, even though the amount  
that changed is quite heavy.  My point is that I don't care too much  
about these one-time fees, but more concerned about the efficiency in  
processing immigration cases.  I am an applicant with I-485 pending  
for almost one and half years now, with no movement of any kind at  
all. I know lots of fiends have their name check stucked, with  
explanation that FBI is the one to be blamed. Well, to us, that's the  
US government showing very low efficiency in recruiting talented  
immigrants. 

There is a lot of debate about illegal immigrants, who mainly take  
over those low pay jobs, but how about we, highly educated immigrants  
struggling in these timing consuming LEGAL pathway? Does anyone care  
about us? 

Well, my voice maybe too faint to wake up anyone, but I feel I need  
to say it aloud!
