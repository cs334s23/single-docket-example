Dear Director, Regulatory Management Division, U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services, Department of Homeland Security, 

My name is Marissa Machado and I am the International Student 
Admissions Coordinator at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

In 1998, our students paid $70 to file the form I-765 with USCIS. In 
1999 they paid $100, the years 2000 and 2002 $120. Examples of the 
proposed fees include: OPT (I-765) current: $180, proposed new fee: 
$340. Change of status (I-539) current: $200, proposed new fee: $300. 
Replace lost I-94 (I-102) current: $160, proposed new fee: $320. 

This is very upsetting because in the 2004/2005 academic year there were 
8,491 international students in Minnesota. According to iie.org they 
spent $172,057,746 in tuition, fees and living expenditures for 
themselves and their dependents. Our students must create solid 
portfolios, take English language tests, jump through many academic and 
financial hoops and leave their families in their home countries in 
order to contribute to the U.S. industry and economy. At MCAD they are 
full-tuition paying and must meet the Financial Certification amount of 
$36,214 and receive no need-based scholarships. For my small school of 
600 Bachelor of Fine Arts candidates this equals a contribution of 
approximately $350,000 to our institution and local community. 

By raising fees, it looks like the U.S. is not a welcoming place for 
international students. Many students feel that they are getting 
'nickeled and dimed". They bring so much money to our country as is that 
asking them to pay more for necessary processing forms seems 
short-sighted. 

I fear that in return the U.S. will see retaliation fee hikes for our 
off campus studies students like the one announced last week. "Fee Hike 
for International Students in Singapore. Singapore's Ministry of 
Education is planning to increase fees paid by international students."

<http://www.business-standard.com/common/storypage.php?autono=273244&lef  
tnm=6&subLeft=0&chkFlg>  And why shouldn't they? The country of Ireland 
just changed its policy so that a student registration with the police 
costs 100 euros. Just last year our spring 2006 study abroad 
participants paid nothing. It is hard enough to encourage U.S. students 
to forfeit their work study money, sub-lease their apartment, save money 
for today's exchange rate of $1 to .52 United Kingdom Pounds and apply 
for student visas. Although strong-willed students will always find a 
way to a global experience, added fees like Singapore's will not help my 
recruiting efforts. 

Please do not dramatically increase your fees this year. 

Thank you.

ACTION ALERT 

On February 1, 2007, USCIS issued a proposed rule with DRASTIC increases 
to the processing fees for most of its applications and petitions.  The 
public comment period to the proposed rule ends April 2, 2007.  Only you 
can provide the information to the USCIS and your members of Congress 
about the impact of the possible new rules on your students, scholars, 
and the ability of colleges and universities to recruit and hire the 
best and the brightest. 

The increase filing fees will directly affect students, scholars, and 
the colleges and the universities that hire them.  The filing fee for 
employment authorization required by international students applying for 
OPT would nearly double.   A change of status filing would increase 68% 
from $200 to $300.  Filing for an employment-based green card (I-140) 
will increase from $195 to $475.  A full listing of the fees is 
available on the NAFSA website 
<http://www.nafsa.org/regulatory_information.sec/regulatory_document_lib  
rary.dlib/fees_forms_and_processing/proposed_uscis_fee_hikes> . 

The fees will not be raised until USCIS publishes a final rule.  USCIS 
and your members of Congress need to be aware of the negative impact of 
the proposed fee increases.  Your personalized (please see the 
instructions on the next page for examples of personalization you should 
add) letter detailing this impact is vital.  Please take a few minutes 
to let them know how this will negatively impact your institution!  To 
view the sample letter and take action, please visit
