We are appalled by your proposal to raise the rates for the I600/I600A.  We felt the fee was high 
to begin with.  We are adopting from China and have paid the fee once and because of the long 
wait times we will have to pay it again.  That is very wrong as well.  The U.S. government has no 
business raising rates as they have over the last few years. 

We are completing against the rates being raised!
