Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am a parent of a child we adopted from Ukraine in December, 2005.  I am concerned at 
the proposed rate hike to file paperwork in order to complete an adoption overseas!  
Please know that we who apply for these papers are US citizens and we are trying to 
build our families in a very special, albeit already very expensive, way!  I am writing to 
ask that there be an exception made to those US citizens adopting minor children 
overseas.  Thank you.
