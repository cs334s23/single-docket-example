Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS- 2006-0044 

I'd like to go on the record opposing the increases in various adoption and citizenship-
related filing fees at DHS.  International adoption is expensive enough that increasing 
these fees makes it even more difficult for already over-burdened parents.  In addition, 
acquiring a birth certificate in the US probably costs, at most, $15/$20 per copy.  Forcing 
parents to pay over $200 for a certificate of citizenship is ridiculous enough but 
increasing it to well over $400 is unbelievable.  I have four international adopted 
children.  Is it reasonable to think I actually have $1840 to pay for certificates?  That's 
absurd.  I paid several hundred dollars in fees to then INS for the paperwork to bring my 
children into this country and now to have to pay almost $2,000 for certificates of 
citizenship is ridiculuous.  Not only that, but the service provided by DHS in processing 
these form is very, very poor.  I strongly oppose the increa se in these fees and hope you 
reconsider this proposed rule.  At the very least, you should exempt American families 
who've adopted these children from the fees.
