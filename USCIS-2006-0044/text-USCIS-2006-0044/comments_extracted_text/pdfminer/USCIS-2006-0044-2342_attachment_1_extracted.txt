Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

My family is currently going through the process of adopting 
internationally.  We found the recent news of imigration fee 
increases troubling.  It's one thing to have a phased in 
rate increases, but an instant 66% increase is just unfair. 
    Many families are doing everything they can to raise the 
necessary funds to complete their adoptions.  Now we are 
expected to raise hundreds of additional dollars, money that 
could and should be spent for the welfare of our children. 
    We ask you to reconsider these rate increases or at the 
very least to phase these increases in over the next several 
years.  Our family can understand your current lack or 
resources, we're simply asking you to understand ours.  Do 
what is right by the American family.
