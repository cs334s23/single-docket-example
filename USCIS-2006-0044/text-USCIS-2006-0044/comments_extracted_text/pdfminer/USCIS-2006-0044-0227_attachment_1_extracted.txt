Dear Sirs;
As a U.S. Citizen and former Immigrant, I am appalled and 
outraged at this current blatant attempt to extort funds from 
potential legal immigrants and/or discourage them from applying 
for immigrant staus in the first place.

Using the excuse that "more cash will make us more efficient"(?), 
my own clearly remembered  ordeal of immigrating ( from 
Australia, no less, what was I thinking! ), leads me to offer a Reality 
Check for you people; 

It will take more than money to get this department ANY kind of 
competence, speed, or efficiency. 

I well remember the seven-year backlog to the "You may apply for 
Naturalization after two years?" fiasco  in the 1970's. {Immigrating-
with Green Card in '77, couldn't even begin the process 'til '84!}

If you wish to stop people from migrating to the U.S., then I 
suggest you simply close the borders, erect a 20,000 volt fence 
between us, Canada & Mexico, shut down the airports etc.  and  
USCIS can all go & play golf all day, while retiring on a nice 
Federal. Pension, which we immigrants, by our hard work and 
Federal taxes are funding for your benefit, we just get SSI. 

A cost of living increase certainly makes sense, but blatant price 
gouging like this for the same dismal service is a disgrace!
