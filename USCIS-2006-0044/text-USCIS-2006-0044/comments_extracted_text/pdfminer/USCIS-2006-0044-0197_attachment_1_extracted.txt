Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

To whom it may concern: 

The USCIS proposed to increase fees for processing 
many immigrant benefit cases.  I am not against the 
fee increase, so long that USCIS can justify the 
increase by improving their work efficiency.  USCIS 
has publicly claimed that they have reduced the 
average processing time of I485 cases to 6 months.  As 
an active member of some immigration forums on the 
internet, I am only aware of the fact that the six 
months processing time claim is an outright lie. 

I urge that an independent investigation be conducted 
to test the USCIS processing time of employment based 
I485, before your office can grant the proposed rule 
of fee increasing. 

Truly yours, 

Richard Shi
