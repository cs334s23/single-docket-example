Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

It is ridiculous that you guys are proposing yet another increase in fees.  Why must you make it 
harder for people to afford adoption?  It is already hard enough!  If these fees increase I assure 
you that my votes for anyone involved in this will NEVER be on their side again.  We can pay out 
billions to rebuild other countries and welfare but you insist on sticking it to the people that 
support this country through hard and honest work!  Iâ€™m so sick of this!
