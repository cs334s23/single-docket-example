Subject: Please Do Not Increase Service Fees (USCIS-2006-0044) 

I want to strongly urge our responsible decision makers to consider the implications of 
raising service fees for immigrants to this country.  Does any of us actually "come from" 
the United States?  No, we are ALL immigrants from one period of time or another, and 
as we sit comfortably in our citizenship now it is our human mandate to remember the 
struggles of our forefathers and mothers.  To increase these fees is to heighten what is 
already a significant challenge to contemporary immigrants.  These too are our brothers 
and sisters, coming to improve the lives of their family, and to contribute to this nation, 
just as those who went before us.  

Nowhere else in our nation do we take such liberties in raising fees: postage stamps, 
public transportation, even taxes all increase incrementally.  it should be no different for 
the immigration system.  Immigrants are not the "other" but reflect a part of our own 
story, and we should do as we would have done unto us.  

Thank you for your consideration.
