Regarding fee increase for I-600A and associated fingerprints--if service ever got better, the fee 
increases would be easier to handle.  But additional employees are never hired to handle orphan 
petitions and the service gets worse by the year!!  I've never seen a fee increase yet that has 
actually improved the service that we all receive at USCIS offices.  So I'm against another fee 
increase--improve the service and maybe we'll be more willing to pay more.   

Not that I believe this letter will make a bit of a difference--you'll increase the fee anyway, but I'm 
not going to let you get away with it without at least expressing my dissatisfaction with your rotten 
service.   

I am an adoptive parent and actually live in Nevada, where our orphan petition officer is pretty 
decent, but I also worked as a China coordinator for an agency and most offices really stink--Utah 
being among the worst, although most are bad.  Taking 3-4 months and MORE to get an I-171H 
out is absolutely ridiculous and people shouldn't even have to pay a dime for such crappy 
"service"--and I use that term loosely!
