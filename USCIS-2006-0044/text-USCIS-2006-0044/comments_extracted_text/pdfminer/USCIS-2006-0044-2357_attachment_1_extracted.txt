Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

My husband and I are currently waiting to adopt a child from China. When we began the 
process, we were informed that there was a 12 month wait after submitting your 
dossier. Currently, the wait time for a child has grown to 18 months, is steadily 
increasing, and predicted to be at least 24 months soon. This means that we will need to 
renew our application to adopt (I-600A) and fingerprints at least once before traveling to 
China. 

Adoption is expensive enough already, and it is unconscionable to raise fees by up to 
66% for adoption related petitions.  I urge you to reconsider this proposed regulation. 
Many people are struggling now to come up with the funds to adopt and this will only 
increase their burden. Adoption is a wonderful thing and the government should not make 
it more costly than it needs to be by increasing fees up to 66%.
