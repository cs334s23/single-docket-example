To Whom It May Concern: 

On behalf of adoptive parents, we would like to encourage you to please reconsider the proposed 
USCIS fee increase.   

Adoption is difficult, emotionally and financially.  There are many of us who spend every spare 
penny we have to bring a child home to America.  A few hundred dollars more may not seem like 
a lot of money, but for some of us it could mean the difference between adopting or not.  Children 
in orphanages are the most vulnerable people on the planet; they need to be granted entry into 
this country and given access to all of the freedoms offered more than anyone else and making 
the process more expensive means that more children may be left behind.   

Please reconsider this fee increase.  Thank you. 
Shaun & Katie Yeatts
