Sir/Madam, 

It is already a burden for a family of 4 to spend $1600 on 
naturalization, and with this proposed fee increase, the cost will be 
$2700 (almost double).  
So I would highly appreciate if you take into consideration of families 
like me before making this proposal a reality. 

Thanks, 
Raj
