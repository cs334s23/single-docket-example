I would like to go on record as opposing the rate increase - families who are adopting do not have 
unlimited funds and as it stands many often have to redo this paperwork before the final leg of 
their adoption journey.  In this instance, you are holding people who wish to create their family 
through international adoption hostage as they will be forced to pay these fees which are 
increasing by 66% which is way too high. 

Thank you
