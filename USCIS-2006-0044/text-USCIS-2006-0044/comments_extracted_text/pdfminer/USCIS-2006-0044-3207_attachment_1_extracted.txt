Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I would love to see the fees remain the same and not increase.  It is already very difficult 
for people who are adopting to raise enough money to take care of every expense 
necessary to bring their child home.  Please, please consider leaving the cost of 
fingerprinting and submission of the I-600A the same as it is now.  Have mercy on those 
of us who are adopting. 

Thank you very much! 

Jennifer E. Gampp
