RE:  DHS Docket No. USCIS 2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I urge you to reconsider the plan to raise the fees charged for processing immigration 
applications.   

Many people have been brought to this country by family members who have struggled 
to earn the transportation fees and then to support the family members until they are able 
to find work.  Many of the persons applying were brought here in the wombs of their 
mothers or as infants and toddlers.  For all practical purposes, the ARE U.S. citizens.  
Those who apply are working and have managed to learn English.  If one considers, 
remittances in addition to the foregoing, they are certainly productive citizens.  And, 
finally, this is just a scam to enable corporations to enact the guest worker program and 
pay both citizens and noncitizens lower wages without health and pension benefits. 

It is a national disgrace to make U.S. citizenship unaffordable.  

Thank you for your consideration.
