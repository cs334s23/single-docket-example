Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I ask you to re-consider the fee increase proposal for adoption-related petitions.  The current 
overall cost of international adoption is very expensive - roughly $20,000 for a single China 
adoption.  Many families struggle between wanting to adopt a child and having the appropriate 
funds to do so.  Increasing the adoption-related petitions will make it more difficult for families to 
adopt abroad. 

Please re-consider this proposal and discontinue it. 

Regards, 
Julia
