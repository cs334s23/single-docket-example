Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern, 

This is regarding the USCIS docket # USCIS-2006-0044, which includes substantial increases in 
fees.  I am currently in the process of an international adoption.  I am concerned about this 
increase.  My husband and I were required to pay $545 in application fees and $70 each for 
fingerprinting fees for our I600A application.   

My concerns are that adoption is a costly endeavor.  I feel that adoption is a wonderful way to 
build a family, and for many the only way to become parents.  It seems unrealistic to require 
these families to face additional costs, when adoptions costs are already high. 

Please consider maintaining the fees at the current rate.  Raising these fees may hinder many 
from adopting, and therefore leaving children who need to be adopted without a home or family.   

Think about it. 

Respectfully, 

Caroline Johnston
