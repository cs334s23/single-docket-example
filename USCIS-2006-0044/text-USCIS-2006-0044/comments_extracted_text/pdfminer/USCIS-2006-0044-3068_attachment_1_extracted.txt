I am sending this email in regards to the proposed increase in fees.  As an adoptive parent 
I know from personal experience how much hard work and money goes into the adoption 
process.  It took us years to put together the funds needed to adopt our first child and it 
saddens me to see the increase in fees and it makes it harder for people to adopt. 

There are many many children around the world that need good homes and there are 
many many wonderful families that want to give these children the loving home they 
deserve but so many of these families are not able to afford the increasing fees. 

As a parent who has adopted and wants very much to adopt again I ask that you please 
reconsider this fee increase and keep the fees at an affordable rate. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Margaret Stalcup
