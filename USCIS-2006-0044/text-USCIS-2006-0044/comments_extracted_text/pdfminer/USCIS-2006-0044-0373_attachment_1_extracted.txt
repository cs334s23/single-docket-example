Subject: citizenship costs 

I am writing to raise my voice against the dramatically high increases in the cost of 
applying for U.S. citizenship. The increased costs may deter those here illegally from 
applying, however, I am uncertain that it will keep people from immigrating in the first 
place, thus there is the problem of even more illegal immigrants. At the same time, it 
deters those who would make a fine contribution as legal citizens of our country from 
even trying, thus tying up the system even more. Please consider the many immigrants 
and refugees who have found a home in the U.S. who have a right to enter the process of 
citizenship and enjoy the rights we all know as Americans.  

Thank you. 

In Christ,
