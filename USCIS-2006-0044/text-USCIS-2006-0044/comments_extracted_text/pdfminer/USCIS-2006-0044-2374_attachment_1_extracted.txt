Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I recently adopted a wonderful child from China. Our wait time was 2 years. And predictions are 
that the wait will go even longer. We had to reapply for our I600 and have our biometrics redone, I 
am still trying to figure out how my fingerprints can expire.  I can imagine it may get to the point 
that you may need to redo twice at the current expiration times.  

To increase these fees and do nothing about extending the expirations seems to be almost 
criminal. An increase in fees would not be unexpected or unreasonable, but to increase the fees 
that dramatically and do nothing about the expirations is just wrong. Especially knowing that US 
citizens will be paying twice because they are stuck in a wait they have absolutely no control 
over. To say that is completely unjust and unfair doesn't even begin to cover it.  

Please feel free to check your own records as to how many folks had to apply twice because 
waiting for their child took longer than your expirations.  

Again, raise the fees if you must  but adjust the expirations to accomadate the wait times.  

Sincerely 
Mary Ann McCullough
