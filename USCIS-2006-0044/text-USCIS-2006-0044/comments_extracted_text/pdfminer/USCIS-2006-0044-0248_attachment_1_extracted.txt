Subject: UNFAIR 

I THINK IS TOO MUCH THE INCREASE OF THE DIFFRENT PETITION THAT YOU ARE GOING 
TO DO. IT IS UNFAIR BECAUSE IF A FAMILY HAVE TOO MANY MEMBERS TO DO AN 
ADJUSTMENT THEY CAN NOT DO IT .IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE THE SAME THING HAPPEN FOR 
A CITIZENSHIP IS TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A PERSON WITH A MINIMUN WAGE THEY HAVE 
TO SAVE YEARS TO BE A CITIZEN. 
I HOPE AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO DO ANY PROCEES THAT YOU CONSIDER 
THAT THIS INCREMENT CAN BE ACESSIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE.
