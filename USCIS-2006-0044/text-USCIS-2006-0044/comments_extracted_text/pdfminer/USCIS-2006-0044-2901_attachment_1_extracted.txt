USCIS Comments 

Dear USCIS Comments: 

I am a parent to two children adopted internationally.  I oppose the raise 
in rates proposed for USCIS known as "Adjustment of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule."  I have a 
hard time understanding why the fees are increasing especially when the 
fees that apply to international adoption (fingerprinting, I-600a) are 
part of documents that are fairly cut and dry and involve little 
investigation since most of the investigation has already been done by the 
home study provider.  I also have held off applying for my first 
daughter's Certificate of Citizenship (adopted before the Citizenship Act 
went into effect) because the application is so expensive. She deserves 
one.  I should be able to go to a window with her birth certificate from 
China and our adoption papers and leave with a Certificate of Citizenship 
-- or at least one in a relatively short period of time. 

Instead I'm facing a larger fee, if I ever get around to applying for that 
Certificate for her, even though she is already a citizen by virtue of the 
Citizenship Act.  Have you considered a separate application for citizens 
naturalized via adoption - at a lower fee schedule? 

Sincerely, 

Christine Brame
