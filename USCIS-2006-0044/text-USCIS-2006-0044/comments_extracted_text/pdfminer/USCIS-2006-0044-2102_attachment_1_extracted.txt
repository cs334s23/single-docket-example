Dear friends, 

I write to express my concern regarding the proposed increase in fees for applications for 
citizenship.  
While I certainly understand the need to fund the review process, the proposed fees 
strike  me as  short sighted.  Living in the St. Paul-Minneapolis area of Minnesota I see 
first hand the tremendous economic development benefits immigrant and refugee 
communities bring to our Twin Cities.  University Avenue and Lake Street-- central 
arteries of our cities have transformed from scary, dead, boarded up corridors  to vibrant, 
successful commercial areas over the course of a little less than 10 years--primarily by  
immigrant entrepreneurial activity.  Because the proposed fees are so out of line with 
what is affordable for  these new Americans, I expect it will diminish the resources going 
into new business formation--resulting in reduced stability for families and communities 
and a diminution in the formation and growth of new businesses. Penny wise and pound 
foolish.  

Sincere regards, 
Katy Lowery
