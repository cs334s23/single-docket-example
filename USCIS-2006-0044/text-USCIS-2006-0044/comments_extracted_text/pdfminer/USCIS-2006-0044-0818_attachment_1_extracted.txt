Subject: Immigration Fees 

To whom it may concern: It is my opinion that there should NOT be ANY fees for 
legalization other than finds for breaking the law. My reasoning is based on the fact that 
legal immigrants actually are an added source of income to the USA Government and 
should be made feel they are welcomed in the USA. The cost of the legalization (green 
cards or citizenships) could be paid by the contributions that undocumented workers pay 
to the Social Security administration and will never benefit from their contributions (It 
has been publicized that those contributions are in the billions of dollars and are in a 
limbo account). This w ill result in a winn winn situation which is what we should be 
trying to accomplish.
