Dear Director, 

I am writing to you to ask that immigration and naturalization fees NOT 
be increased to the levels of the proposed changes. An increase in 
these fees is counter productive and forces immigrants into meeting the 
self fulfilling prophecy of the anti-immigrant mentality. Immigrants 
are often accused of not wanting to assimilate. The proposed increase 
in the fee structure will force people to not assimilate because they 
are being priced out of the ability to do so, and thus the myth is 
perpetuated. 

I believe it will be more efficient and effective to include a 
realistic fee structure as part of an overall comprehensive and 
positive immigration reform package so that the fee structure helps 
ensure the success of positive immigration reform. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Thomas C. Shortell, FDP
