I am strongly opposed to the proposed adjustment of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule. This enormous 
increase not only encourages illegal immigration by making legal immigration 
less economically feasible, but also puts a tremendous burden on American 
citizens sponsoring immigrant relatives.
