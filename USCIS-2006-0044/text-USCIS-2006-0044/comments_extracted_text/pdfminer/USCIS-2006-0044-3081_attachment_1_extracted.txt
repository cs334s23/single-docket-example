Emilio Gonzalez 
USCIS Director 

Dear Emilio Gonzalez: 

Last Tuesday I was walking past the Federal offices in Sacramento, CA when 
I saw a long line of new citizens and their families waiting to undergo 
their naturalization ceremony. This sight filled me with pride! I was 
dismayed when I heard today that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
plans to raise the costs of applying for American citizenship to a level 
that may be beyond the reach of many recent immigrants. 

During the past 12 years, the application costs have risen 400 percent. 
USCIS has proposed raising the cost of a green card from $325 to $905, a 
citizenship application from $330 to $595 and fingerprinting from $70 to 
$80. 

USCIS is one of the few government agencies that operates primarily on 
user fees, yet it plans to put an additional burden on people already 
working as hard as possible to become lawful U.S. citizens. Naturalization 
for a family of four would rise to $2,430. 

Congress should appropriate the funds necessary to allow thousands of 
hard-working immigrants to gain citizenship at a cost they can afford and 
USCIS should absolutely not enact these dramatic increases. 

Sincerely, 

Victoria Tedder
