Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

This is to comment on the proposed increase in fees 
for international adoption.  
The proposed increase is 66%!!  That is outrageous, 
considering how much we are paying already.  As 
adoptive parents, we hop through many, many hoops, all 
of which involve fees.  But, a 2/3 increase is 
monumental and will effect the ability of many to 
finance an adoption.  
In addition, the paperwork (I-171H) expires in 15 
months, and the fingerprints expire in 12 months!! 
For those of us adopting from China, the wait times 
right now are 16-18 months, which means we fill out 
ALL this paperwork TWICE!!  
The increase in fees might seem more reasonable if it 
didn't need renewed for 24 months, and if the 
fingerprints were good for the same amount of time. 
It feels like USCIS is taking advantage of the 
thousands of prospective adoptive parents in this 
country.  
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to weigh in on 
this topic. 
Sincerely, 
Bonnie Behling 
future parent to daughter from China
