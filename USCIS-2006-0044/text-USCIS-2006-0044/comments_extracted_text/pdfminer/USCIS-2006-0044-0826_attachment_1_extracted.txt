DHS: 

I have recently looked at the Proposed USCIS Fee Hikes 2007, and am 
dismayed at one of the proposed fee hikes in particular.  The proposal to 
increase the fee for Form I-765 ( Application for Employment Authorization) 
from $180 to $340 would make it very difficult for foreign students with 
F-1 visas to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT).  The 12 months of 
OPT currently permitted for these foreign students makes it possible for 
them to earn money during summer months and up to 12 months after 
graduation while gaining experience in a field related to their major.  The 
stipends are usually not large--often in the nature of an internship--but 
they are an invaluable way for a company to judge the student's competency 
and for the student to gain experience.  An 89% increase in the application 
fee would be financially prohibitive for many. 

I hope that the increase in Form I-765 fees will be cancelled or students 
be exempt from this increase. 

Thank you for your attention. 

Sincerely,
