Please hold the line on the costs incurred by immigrants appying for citizenship, bringing next of 
kinand other formalities required of them in establishing a new life in the U.S.  They have a 
difficult enough time getting a new life established here without facing expenses which would act 
as a deterrent to their taking needful and proper actions toward becoming American citizens.  
The proposed increases seem totally unreaso0nable and would impose hardships on those who 
already face more hardships and red tape barriers than they need.
