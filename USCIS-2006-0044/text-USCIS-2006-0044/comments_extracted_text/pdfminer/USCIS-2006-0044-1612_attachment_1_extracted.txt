To whom this concerns, 

I am a international student studying in my master's degree in Kent State University, 
Ohio. I would like to comment on I-765, I-539 processing fee increase plans. I have 
recently heard this news at a H1-B workshop held from our school international student 
office. Being an international student, I am living under a tight budget which barely 
covers my living expense from limited working hours and location. This idea of doubling 
the processing fee doesn't sound reasonable to me unless there is a 
convincing explanation to the increase. Given that this issue is applicable only to non-
residents in the US seeking a job opportunity, I oppose to the the fee increase and suggest 
that the fee should be fixed or lowered. 

Representing one of the numerous international students in the United States,
