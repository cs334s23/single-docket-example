Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am writing as a concerned citizen and adoptive parent concerning the proposed increase. I do 
not support an increase as I feel the fees are already substantial and many of us are being 
required to refile our applications due to long wait times. This puts an even larger finanicial 
burden on the middle class adoptive parent.  I am very concerned that adoption is only being 
limited to the rich.  Please consider this proposal carefully with the children in mind.   

Sincerely,
