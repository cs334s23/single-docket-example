Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 Adjustment of the Immigration Benefit Application/ Petition and 
Biometric Fee Schedule 

In reference to: 
USCIS-2006-0044 Adjustment of the Immigration Benefit Application/ Petition and Biometric Fee 
Schedule 

I understand fee increases are a normal part of "business".  I fully support the fee increase 
to allow the USCIS to continue supporting international adoptions.  I would hope, however, the 
USCIS could take a look at two key points regarding processing the I-600A and I-171H. 

First, the I-600A is only good for 18 months.  Based on current processing times for most 
international adoptions, prospective parents will likely have to file twice.  I recommend 
extending the length of time the I-171H is good for to 24 months.  People may be able to 
process the adoption within that time frame. 

Second, the fingerprints expire at a different time than the I-171H. Again, this all but 
assures prospective parents will need to apply twice, and that means to pay twice!  I 
recommend extending the fingerprint expiration date to match the I-171H expiration (hopefully 
at least 24 months). 

If these two points were considered, I fully support the fee increase.  If not, then I will 
need to start saving now so I can make sure I can afford the second application, especially 
when the fees go up nearly 66%.  

Thanks for your consideration.
