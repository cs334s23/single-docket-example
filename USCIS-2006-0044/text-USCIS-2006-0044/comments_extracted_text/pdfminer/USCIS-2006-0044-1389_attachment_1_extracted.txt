Subject: No more increases 

In my opinion immigration should not increase the fees for any application. 
This agency is receiveng millions of dollars annually and so far the service is 
getting worse. All the processes are getting longer. There is more 
discrimination during the interviews.  
People are struglling with high gasoline prices, higher inflation and cost of living.  
Why the increases have to be over 5%, why 287%! That is outregous, that is too much.  
Immigration has been increasing fees many times and instead of hire more workers to 
speed up the process, it is getting worse and slower. 
Workers are drinking more coffee and sociliazing in the offices instead servicing the 
public who has to wait hours to be interview. 
As a human act stop the proposed increases. 
enough is enough.
