RE:  DHS Docket #USCIS-2006-0044 -Proposed  Rule to Adjust the Immigration 
and Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule - OPPOSE 

On behalf of the Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara County, I am writing to express our 
strong opposition to the proposal by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to 
increase its fees.  Vle proposed increases arc substantial, especially those related to 
applying for citizenship and permanent residency.  We urge USCIS to reconsider the 
proposal and seck other sources of funding for its operations. 

As proposed, the fee for an Application for Naturalization would increase by  178% from 
$325 to $905, while the fee for an Application to Registcr Permanent Status or Adjust 
Status would be raised by SO%, from $330 to $595.  When considering the actual net 
costs to applicants from all the proposed new fees, the average fee increases from $264 to 
$438 - a 66% increase. 

Thirty-six pccent of the residents in Santa Clara County are immigants, the highest 
percentage among California counties.  Paying significantly higher fees for USCIS 
services would be a considerable hardship for low-income immigrants in our county, 
possibly preventing them from seeking United Stales citizenship or permanen1 residcnt 
status. 

In 2000-2001, whcn the fee for adult naturalization was $225,41% of lawful permanent 
residents who were eligible, but had not naturalized had incomes considered "low 
income" (below 200 percent of  the poverty level).  However, those who had recently 
naturalized had considerably higher incomes with only 28% considcrcd low income.

Page 2 

The country experiences significant benefits f ~ o m  promoting citizenship or permanent 
residency.  Citizenship allows immigrants to participate fully in the civic liEe of the 
country by permitting them to vote in elections, run for office, and serve on juries. 
Immigrants who become citizens of the United States take the oath of citizenship and 
pledge to support the values and laws of our country. 

The services provided by USCIS lead to overall public benefit and therefore, the costs of 
the services should not fall solely on the individuals pursuing U.S. citizenship or 
permanent residency.  USCIS should seek other funding sources, rather than overly 
burden one segment of our population.  The County of Santa Clara strongly urges you to 
reconsider your proposal to increase fees.
