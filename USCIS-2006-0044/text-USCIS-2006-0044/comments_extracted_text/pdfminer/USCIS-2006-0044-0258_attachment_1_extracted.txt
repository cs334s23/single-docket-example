Dear sirs: 

I have just read that the Immigration Service is considering a raise in the fees for 
immigration applications. My great grandparents were poor Eastern Europeans. Had there 
been steep fees for their entry, I wouldn't be here.  From such humble beginnings, my 
grandfather became what would now be equivalent to a millionaire.  
I think it is a serious mistake to raise the fees for incoming immigrants.The majority of 
immigrant come to America for a better life, because their present situation leaves 
something to be desired.  How can we require that they already have a high standard of 
living before they have arrived?  

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Martha D. McNair
