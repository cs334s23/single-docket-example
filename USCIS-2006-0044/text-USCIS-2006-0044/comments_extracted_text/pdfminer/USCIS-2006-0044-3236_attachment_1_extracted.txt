Subject: [Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044];[FR Doc: E7-01631];[Page 4887-4915]; Immigration: B 

This letter is in regard to the above docket number, and proposed increase in 
fees.  

Our family is currently in the process of adopting our daughter from China. This 
has been one of the most daunting challenges that we have ever faced, 
emotionally and financially. We were hesitant to even attempt adoption due to the 
cost, but as Christians, we believed that God had led us to adopt. We are middle 
class Americans, working to provide for our 2 biological boys as well as preparing 
for our daughter.  

Due to the increased wait time in China, we are currently having to resubmit 
paperwork and have our fingerprints redone. All of this is costly and any increase 
would only hurt families that are in the same situation. I am afraid it would also 
cause families that are considering adoption to become less likely to begin the 
process. Each dollar counts in this journey.  

I would like to ask you to reconsider any adjustments in the fees for international 
adoption. I believe that every orphan deserves a home and that any cost 
increase may keep the average family from attempting to adopt, therefore 
preventing one less child from having a forever family. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
