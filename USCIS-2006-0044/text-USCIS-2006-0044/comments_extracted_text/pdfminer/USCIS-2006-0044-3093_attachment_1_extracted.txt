Subject: about increase fee to become a US citizen 

As you know, many refugee and immigrants have jobs that pay minimum wages.  They can not 
even effort to buy a good health meal to put on the table for their children.  By increasing 66% fee 
for becoming a US citizen is too much for them. 

Thanks,
