Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

I am writing to voice my disapproval of the proposed fee increase for naturalization.  This is 
nothing more than a gouge in the wallet and no one believes the increase will go to "better serve" 
USCIS clients or "streamline the process" or anything like that.  I am assisting a 66 year old friend 
with the naturalization process and such an increase will be a hardship.  He is low-income but not 
low income enough to apply for a fee waiver.  In addition, the fee waiver system is a crap shoot.  
If an applicant's request for waiver is denied he must re-apply and pay another fee. 
No to any increase in fees.
