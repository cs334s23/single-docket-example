I just wanted to comment on the proposed increase on application fees 
for Citizenship. I think this 
makes good sense especially after applications have doubled in the last 
year! I know you have to hire 
more staff to process these folks. We have a disasterous immigration 
issue going on right now and 
taxpayers do not want to pick up the tab for those applying for 
citizenship!! 

I frankly feel we should be limiting immigration and raising the fees 
even more that what you have 
requested!! 

I have written to my state lawmakers telling them to vote for the 
increase in fees! 

Thank you for doing your job and staying on top of this!! 

Sincerely, 

Shirley Cameron
