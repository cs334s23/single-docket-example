Hello, 

My husband and I are adoptive parents of a little girl from China.  We've received 
notice of the increase in the USCIS fees for the I600/A and are quite surprised to 
learn that the costs being proposed are growing by more than 66% from the base 
today.  In addition, many forms like the I171H will expire while families are waiting 
for their referral which will cost more to have an updated I171.  This amounts to 
more than 140% increase.   Adoption is expensive enough already.  It seems to me 
there is a better way to manage the costs for adoptive families than penalizing 
them.   We feel that there are other ways to address the immigration costs for non-
adoptive individiuals coming into the United States. 

We hope that there is some reconsideration of these fees for adoptive families. 

Regards,
