Dear Director: 
As a customer trying to adjust my status from arriving in this county as a student on a track scholarship.  I 
personally do believe that an increase in fee is reasonable.  With the way immigration is going today, more 
people will have needs, and workers need to get paid.  If people want to get legal in this country then they 
should not mind paying the fee - no matter what the cost may be.  Immigration is a business, and a business 
has to have funds to support it's business.
