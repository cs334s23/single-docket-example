Subject: hikes in prices for immigration services 

Is it possible that it is right to continue to make it harder and harder for honest and decent folks to 
become a citizen of this country?  We want people to follow our laws and rules, but then we 
continually set up walls and roadblocks from them to do so.  
Please reconsider and come up with a formula that is fair and just, not just lucrative. 

Thanks
