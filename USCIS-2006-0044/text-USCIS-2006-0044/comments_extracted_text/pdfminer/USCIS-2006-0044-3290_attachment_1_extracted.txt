Hello, 
My name is Pat Gispert and I have had the wonderful experience of adopting 
my daughter from China.  It is a lengthy process with many forms and fees 
involved to keep on top of and very time sensitive.  As you know due to 
delays in adoption paperwork process these forms have to be redone tto 
remain up to date which involves a higher cost to the prospective parent. 
while cost rise in all avenues, there is an acceptance for a reasonable cost 
increase.  The propsed raises are very unrealistic and unfare to the 
consumer.  There are children all over the world longing for a family.  It 
is a lengthy and expensive process. By implementing these proposed 
increases, you are decreasing the number of children that woul;d find a 
forever family due to the unrealistic expense.  In addition, for those of us 
that missed the change in USCIS automatically sending the certificate of 
citizenship, the proposed increase in obtaining a certificate of citizenship 
becomes a financial hardship with the proposed increase.  While most 
americans can accept a reasonable increase in fees with the understanding of 
the need for it due to rising cost. However, the proposed increases are 
criminal and have serious implications for prospective adoptive families 
hoping to breing a child home.  Please reconsider this unfair increase so 
that more children can find a forever family and home.  Thanks, Pat
