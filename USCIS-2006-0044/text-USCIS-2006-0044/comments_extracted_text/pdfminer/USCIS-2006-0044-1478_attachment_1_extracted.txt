It is a shame that legal residents immigrating their relatives  and those intending to become US 
Citizens must bear the cost of improvement of a system that has for years & decades claimed 
that by increasing fees will do just that improve the system.  

 Last year there were hundred and perhaps thousands of legal residents that applied for 
citizenship  early in 2006 and who are still waiting to be sworn in in California in March 2007   

What gaurantee is there that the system will improve if it hasn't in the past by increasing fees?  
This government keeps attacking those less fortunate who's voice still isn't heard in government 
of the hardship it imposes on them.
