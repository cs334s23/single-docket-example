Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Benefit Application Fee Schedule DOCKET #USCIS-2006---
44-0001 

I am writing to oppose the additional fees and the 
increase fees for the Adjustment of Immigration and 
Naturalization Benefit Application Fee Schedule.  It 
seems to me that raising these fees puts and added 
burden on people who are already paying heavy fees to 
adopt.  I have several friends who have adopted from 
China and are doing so again.  Their paperwork is in, but 
due to the length of time to adopt, they will have to 
refile and thus pay again at a higher fee, as their original 
paperwork will have expired.  We need to reconsider our 
priorities in this country.  We allow illegal immigrants 
into this country with little or no consequences, they 
collect welfare, free health care, pay no taxes and when 
caught, little happens.  We seem to continue to tax, 
charge and penalize our hard working Americans.  What 
will it take for this to stop?  Please consider these people 
and these amazing children who may not be able to be 
adopted because of the increased costs.  Is this good, 
righteous or fair?  I think not.    May God continue to 
bless America, even when America is not blessing God.   
Thank  you for allowing me this opportunity to voice my 
opinion.
