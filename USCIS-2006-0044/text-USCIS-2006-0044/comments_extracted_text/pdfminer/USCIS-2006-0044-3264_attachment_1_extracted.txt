application fee schedule adjustment 

We respectfully ask that you not increase the filing fees.  Families pursuing international 
adoptions are subject to these fees, and because the line for adoptions has become so long, most 
families now have to pay these fees twice.  Increasing these fees would present a hardship for 
many families who are trying to give a loving home to an orphan from another country. 

Thank you for your time, 
Sincerely, 

Robert W. Briscoe
