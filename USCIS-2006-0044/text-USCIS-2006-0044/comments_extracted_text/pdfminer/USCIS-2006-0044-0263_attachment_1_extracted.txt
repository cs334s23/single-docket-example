DHS, 

As a US citizen and of ancestry that came here long ago, I think the increase in fees says that 
American citizenship is for sale. I think it sends the wrong message, while the US is trying to pass 
a guest worker program which would provide those here illegal a means to basically jump in front 
of the line while the US wants to increase fees which are pursuing a legal way to come to the US. 

Perhaps the DHS/US Gov should worry about the illegal’s that are coming here and spreading 
disease, overcrowding and becoming an economic burden on society while the being a US citizen 
is meaningless and our US politicians don’t care about what the people want. It is more important 
to pander to the Mexican government and forcing the American people to take in there people 
when there system is to corrupt or unwilling to fix there own problems. 

Thank you, 

Mr. Murphy
