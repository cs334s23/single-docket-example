Reg: Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Application and 
Petition Fee Schedule  

First of all,  I think this adjustment is outrageous. More than 80% increasing in one 
time? No way, I have not heard a such thing in any forms, anywhere. 5% to 8% is 
more acceptable.  In addition, I don't see the Immigration Department will become 
more efficiency after all. This act only will decline the residents who want to become 
a U.S. citizen in the future.
