Subject: FEES 

IF THESE FEES GO THROUGH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WILL NOT FILE THE 
APPROPRIATE PAPERWORK.  WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF LEGALIZING MY HUSBAND 
AND THE EXPENSE IS ALREADY TO HIGH.  PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY 
THOUSANDS JUST FOR PAPERWORK.  I THINK IT WOULD DETERE PEOPLE FROM 
SEEKING DOCUMENTATION.
