I am strongly against raising the fees for the I-600A, I-600, and N-600.  Families like mine who are 
adopting children already pay many fees to adopt children.  I already consider the fees to be very high and 
this increase should not be required for families who are adopting.  I strongly disagree with the fee 
increase! 

Thanks for your consideration.
