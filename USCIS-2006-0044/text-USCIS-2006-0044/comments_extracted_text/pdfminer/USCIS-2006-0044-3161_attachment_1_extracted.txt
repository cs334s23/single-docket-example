Dear sir or madame: 

I am writing to comment on the proposed fee schedule changes at the Department of 
Homeland Security, US Citizenship and Immigration Services as they relate to adoption 
fees. As the future adoptive mother of an Ethiopian orphan I have worked extra hours, 
taken a home quity loan on my home and budgeted very carefully to be able to afford to 
bring my daughter, who currently resides in an underfunded orphanage in Ethiopian, into 
a better life in the US. Adoptive families wait many months (and sometimes years) for 
their children and in the process endure great financial and emotional stress. The adoption 
tax credit was created to make adoption within the means of average American families. 
Raising the fees we must pay to make the creation of our families legal reduces the 
impact of the tax credit & once again makes adoption an option exclusively for the 
weathly. Please do not penalize families who have worked so hard & suffered so much to 
have the family so many Americans take for granted. 

Sincerely, 
Alison Aucoin
