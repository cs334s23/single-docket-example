Sir: 

I was pleasantly surprised to read the portion of the proposal (Sec III, Par. 5) related to the fees for interim 
benefits associated with Adjustment of Status applications.  I agree with the reasoning that there might be a 
"perception" that the USCIS might be gaining financially from the interim fees. I think that this perception 
is enhanced when the customer is asked to pay additional interim fees beyond the first interim benefit 
application (e.g., Employment Authorizaton). 

Last year my wife applied for Adjustment of Status, but with the delays there was a possibility that the one 
year expiration of the Employment Authorization would force a submission of another EA application with 
another payment. I do not and did not have any concern about the first application's payment, but the 
possibility of a second one when the agency's slow processing times was the cause reflected a LACK OF 
COMMON SENSE in policy. 

I wrote letters to CIS and also addressed this issue on the phone and my local CIS office.  Unfortunately, 
this "pay again" policy's lack of common sense induced a reponse by customer representatives on the phone 
and local office:  "Well, that's the way it is." 

There has to be more than fee changes. There must be a change in employee mindset at all levels of the 
agency utilizing common sense.  I suggest an increase in "in-house" training proportionate to the incresse in 
fees so that the field employees not be placed in such awkward positions.
