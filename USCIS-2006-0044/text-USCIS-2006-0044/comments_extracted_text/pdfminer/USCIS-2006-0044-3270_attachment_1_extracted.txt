Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Please do not increase the fees for the I-600/600A, N-565, and N-600 by more than 5-10%. I 
know that you have expenses, but remember that the families who are seeking to adopt have 
expenses, too.  Also, could you consider creating a simplified and less expensive way to renew I-
600A's for families who have to wait longer than 18 months for an adoption to be completed?  As 
you certainly must already know, those of us adopting from China have not only had to redo our 
fingerprints and I-600A's during our extended wait for a referral, but we've also had to pay for 
updated homestudies, background checks, and renewed physicals . . . even though in our case 
and for many others there were no changes since the original approval was issued. 

Thank you, 
Tara McClure
