Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

We wish to object to the Fee increase for foreign adoption.  As we are going through the process 
of adopting a child internationally, there are several government fees included which keep 
increasing and we have a hard time keeping track of these fees or understanding why they 
increase.  If we received better or faster service, it would be understandable but that is not 
happening.  If an increase is necessary, we do not understand the significant jump in fees. 

Sincerely, 

Steve and Teresa McConaghy
