Dear USCIS, 

I, Art Thompson, am deeply concerned with the proposed increase in the 
application fee for U.S. citizenship and other immigration benefits. 

I believe that USCIS should find a solution that promotes, rather than 
discourages, immigrant integration. I believe the fee increase would 
discourage low-income legal immigrants from pursuing permanent resident 
status and citizenship. This is clearly a strike against integration 
efforts. Encouraging integration is in the national interest because it 
strengthens national security. Inviting and involving immigrants in our 
society’s public institutions is good for our nation. 

The United States is a nation that is strengthened by the contributions 
of newcomers of all backgrounds. Raising the obstacles to integration 
goes against this legacy. 

Finally, I believe the cost of processing immigration and naturalization 
benefit applications and petitions should NOT be on the backs of 
prospective immigrants. I believe Congress should appropriate money for 
technology and infrastructure improvements at USCIS. 

Sincerely, 

Art Thompson
