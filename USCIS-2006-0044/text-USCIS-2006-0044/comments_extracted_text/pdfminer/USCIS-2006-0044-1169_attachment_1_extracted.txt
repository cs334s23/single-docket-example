Subject: comment - DHS Docket # USCIS - 2006 - 0044 

To whom it may concern, 

The following comments relate to the proposed fee increases for naturalization applications and 
other immigration services. 

I am opposed to the drastic increase in fees under consideration.   

The proposed fee structure would prohibit many otherwise qualified applicants from pursuing 
legal status.  Individuals with limited incomes would never be able to save enough to apply.  
Given that so few undocumented individuals in the U.S. fall into the upper income brackets, this 
proposed fee increase would hit the hard-working landscape tech, construction worker, food 
service worker, custodian, garment worker, meat-packer, roofer. 

In addition to the obvious unfair nature of this fee increase, the thrust of this effort demonstrates a 
counterproductive attitude on the part of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  We want 
people to go through the legal process and become legal residents.  Legal residents have a stake 
in our society. 

Individuals who seeking citizenship or other legal status deserve to deal with an agency that is 
professional, efficient and courteous.  Tthe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services needs to 
demonstrate excellent customer service and reduced wait times for processing applicant 
information. 

Thank you for your consideration.
