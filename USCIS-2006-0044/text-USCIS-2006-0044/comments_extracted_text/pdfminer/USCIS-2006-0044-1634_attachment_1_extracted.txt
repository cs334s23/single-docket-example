Dear Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service: 

I oppose the proposed increases in USCIS service fees.  

I do not think this proposed policy is in keeping with the American 
tradition of welcoming the newcomer, the outsider, the immigrant aspiring 
to a better life. 

I don't think the Bush government cares about the nation or its people.  I 
think it actively seeks to subvert our best institutions and, if you are 
are part of this process, I hope you come to your senses soon and resign.  
These are policies that are cruel and calculated to harm families.  You 
should be ashamed to even contemplate implementing them.  What would your 
own grandparents say? 

It is a pathetic situation that common people like myself -- a high school 
American history teacher -- have to write to our own public servants to 
remind them of the traditional American values of fairness, frugality, 
openness, a welcoming attitude toward the stranger or newcomer, 
opportunity and equality. 

In the name of families, vulnerable populations and those seeking a better 
life, please do not enact the proposed USCIS fee increases. 

Concerned about our nation, 

Robert L. Breckenridge
