Subject: Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 / U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Department 

Director, Management Division 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Department 

RE: Docket #  USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear Sir/Madam, 

I am writing you today to ask you to reconsider the 
proposed increase in filing fees for documents and 
services of your department needed for international 
adoptions. My husband and I are in the final stages of 
an international adoption for which we had to do all 
the paper work twice, because the first agency we had 
acting on our behalf turned out to be fraudulent and 
disappeared with our money. 

Because we had committed our hearts to our adoptive 
orphan daughter and promised her to be her parents we 
could not and would not just drop the whole thing. We 
have nine children of our own who are almost all grown 
up now, so there was no real need for us to adopt 
another child, especially as we are happy to be 
grandparents of six already. 
However, there are millions of older children who like 
our daughter have almost no hope to be adopted before 
they have to leave their orphanages as young adults to 
face a world for which they are not prepared. Their 
education is usually sadly lacking, and their already 
compromised emotional and physical well being is 
seriously threatened by what they encounter in their 
various countries. 

Since their own countries are overwhelmed by the 
situation the majority of all adoptive families are 
US-Citizens. 
I think it is a shame that one of our countryâ€™s 
government agencies wants to profit at all from the 
goodwill of its own citizens who are trying to ease 
the burdens of these children around the globe. Have 
we forgotten, that poverty and insufficient education 
are the main causes that lead millions of young people 
in many countries to follow radical leaders, who will 
abuse them for their own political purposes? Have we 
forgotten that the hopelessness caused by poverty and 
insufficient education also leads other millions of 
young people to become drug dealers, pimps, 
prostitutes, and even murderers who aggravate further 
the circumstances in their own countries, which in 
many ways affects the global economy and eventually 

 
 
 
 
 
 
the USA? 

We realize that adopting just one child from a former 
Eastern Block country will not change the whole world, 
but we know many families who would also adopt 
children from other countries if the red tape and cost 
of international adoptions were not so extremely 
overwhelming for most middle class families. To raise 
an additional child is usually not a problem for such 
families, but the process they have to submit to for 
international adoption is increasingly becoming one. 

By increasing the already outrageously high fees for 
the necessary documentation needed from your 
department you would be compounding the difficulties 
for adoptive families and prevent many more needy 
children from the blessing of being welcomed into a 
loving family! 

In my humble opinion it would be best to drop these 
fees altogether or at least significantly decrease 
them, so as to encourage more families to adopt the 
lost children of this world, because the price we will 
all pay later to deal with them as adults will be 
infinitely higher. 

Sincerely, Eva & Mark Davies
