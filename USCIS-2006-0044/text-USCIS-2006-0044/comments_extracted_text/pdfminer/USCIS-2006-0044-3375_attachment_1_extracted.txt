RE: DHS Docket No. USCIS 2006-0044 

Dear Director of Regulatory Management: 

I write in strong opposition to the proposal by the United States Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (USCIS) to increase the fees for starting the naturalization process. 
Under the USCIS'  proposal, the fee for filing the Form N-400 would increase from $330 
to $595, and the biometrics fee would increase from $70 to $80, resulting in a total 
increase from $400 to $675.  The proposed 69% fee hike i s  an unfair burden for 
hardworking newcomers who wish to become U.S. citizens and participate in everything 
that this nation has to offer. 

Currently, many newcomer families have limited resources, and they work tirelessly to 
save up the money required to pay the current $400 naturalization application cost. 
According to data from the U.S. Census, about one-third (36%) of non-citizen households 
have annual incomes that are less than $25,000.  Family members oAen want to pursue 
U S .  citizenship by applying for naturalization at the same time.  With the increase 
proposed by the USCIS, a family of four would confront a bill amounting to $2,700.  An 
exorbitant price tag should not stand in the way of families seeking to realize the 
American Dream. 

I do not oppose applicants paying a fee to apply for U.S. citizenship and commend the 
USCIS for taking the steps to improve customer services and processing times.  1 also 
understand that the agency believes it needs to raise fees to pay for major inftastructure 
investments and process enhancements, such as improvements in the timeliness of 
background checks, modernization of its outdated business systems, facilities 
improvements and enhancements in its personnel training and recruitment programs. 
However, placing the full costs of these investments on the back of our nation's  legal 
permanent residents is driving fees to a level that immigrants simply cannot afford. 

I urge the USCIS to work with the President and Congress to obtain appropriations to 
supplement fee revenue to cover costs of major USCTS expenses such as infrastructure 
investments, process enhancements and capital improvements.  In the past, Congress has 
appropriated monies to assist the USCIS in facing challenges such as its application 
processing backlog.  The USCIS believes it needs to make significant investments to 
build an Immigration Service for the 21"  Century.  This is precisely the type of challenge 
that should be met through the partnership between applicants paying a reasonable fee 
and the appropriation of Congressional funding.
