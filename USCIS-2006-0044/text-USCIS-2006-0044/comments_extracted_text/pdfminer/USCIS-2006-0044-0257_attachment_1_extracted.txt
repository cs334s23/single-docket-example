Increasing fees for LEGAL immigrants is NOT the answer.  All this will 

do is force more and more use of ILLEGAL immigrants.  STOP... think 

about what you are doing and do something else.  How about enforcing the 

laws on the books which require fines for employers who hire illegal aliens?  

Those fees should be increased and more time should be spent in 

enforcement!
