I would like to comment on the proposed Fee increase. 

I hope that many comments are received concerning this increase, I think it is unconscionable to 
raise fees by up to 66% for adoption related petitions. Adoption is expensive enough already and 
it does put a burden on couples who want to build families. As someone who has been trying for 
over 10 years to have a family and finally have gone the adoption route only to have the hurdle of 
trying to pay for it and pay expenses when sometimes there is no guarantee of a child, I am 
frustrated by the process. I can not believe that the documents expire within a such a short period 
of time when international adoption can take up to 2 years or more. This I already think is a 
problem and to raise the fees and then we are expected to pay them probably 2 times seem 
ludicrous. I guess the real truth is that you do have us, because we will pay because we are 
desperate families who want to love and raise a child. I would hope that you can re look at this 
proposal, I understand costs increase but 66% seems high and if that is the case I would hope 
that the time could lengthen that the forms would be valid for or the tax reduction could be 
increased. 

Thanks for listening,
