Hi - 

I just wanted to make a quick comment about the 
increasing adoption fees.  I understand that, over 
time, costs increase for everything, and if this were 
a small increase I probably wouldn't feel as I do. 
But the USCIS fees for adoptions have been increasing 
MUCH faster than the cost of living.  This is 
particularly true since many adoptive families must 
now pay the fees twice, due to increased adoption wait 
times and the time limits on the documents. 

Would you please: 

1.  Reconsider the fee increases and either reduce or 
eliminate the increases related to adoption.  It is 
difficult and expensive to adopt, yet the benefits to 
society of having these children in happy families 
(instead of orphanages or, worse, on the streets or in 
terrorist training camps that will feed them) are 
enormous. 

2.  If fees must be increased due to increased costs, 
please consider changing the expiration policy for 
these documents.  The risk to homeland security of 
adopting a child is considerably less than the risk 
associated with immigration of adults.  Do the 
documents really need to expire so soon (with 
fingerprints expiring even sooner)?  

Thank you for your consideration of my requests. 

Regards, 
Barbara Rayle
