Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS 2006-0044 

I adamantly oppose a fee increase for residents 
wanting to become citizens.  This would increase an 
already exorbitant amount that many would be unable to 
pay.  When I became a citizen, the fee I paid was hard 
to come by, and I can't imagine it would be easier for 
immigrants, most working low-paying jobs and 
supporting families, to pay an already high amount.  
Please reconsider the fee hike and give immigrants a 
break. Let that extra money go to the economy.
