Subject: DHS Docket no. USCIS 2006-0044 

February 17, 2007 

We are writing regarding DHS Docket no. USCIS  2006-0044  regarding the proposed 
huge increase in fees for immigration documents. 

At first glance it all sounds good.  However,  CIS has consistantly for many many years 
provided very poor service. 

If and ONLY IF improved and accurate service can be provided then should such a huge 
increase in fees be considered. 

A point in question or example. 

My wife entered the US on November 09, 2005 on a K -1 visa.  We were married on 
January 10, 2006. 

I-485 along with I-131 and I-765 were submitted to the Neb. office on January 11, 2006 

After many months of no information and many many 550 mile round trips to the Denver 
office seeking information, we were told to "refile" our application with the Denver 
office.  Penny Acosta. 

We did so on July 10, 2006  In August of 2006 my wife was fingerprinted.  An interview 
was schedule for September 14, 2006 but the CIS "lost" or misplaced her file. 

A 2nd interview was schedule and held on October 14, 2006. 

As of today, February 17, 2007 4 months after the interview, my wife is still waiting for 
her green card.  She cannot work, she cannot travel back home to visit family, so 
basically she is a prisoner in the US. 

We refiled the I-131 and I 765 in September of 2006 with the Chicago lock box address 
and we are still waiting for a response from them. 

My wife is a highly trained and skilled Registered Nurse with over 15 years experience. 

Every day in our local newspaper there are dozens of ads begging for nurses to come to 
work.  Each day my wife must sit and can not do anything.  No work. No travel. 

 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
So when we received horrible service and sometimes "hostile" service from CIS, we 
cannot in good conscience support a huge increase in fees unless there is a 1000 % 
increase in service. 

Being told that our I-485 is being processed month after month after month just does not 
cut it for us. 

The man that conducted the interview with my wife and son was almost openly hostile to 
them and made many many snide remarks about immigrants.  Our Colorado Senators 
offices both report that they have received hundreds of complaints about this man but 
nothing happens.  He just continues to do his terrible work and we the paying public have 
to put up with it. 

Just ask any US Senators office about how many immigration complaints they receive 
and you will find it to be a staggering amount. 

Colorado will not even allow my wife to have a drivers learners permit so she can at least 
learn to drive while waiting.  They insist she is not a "legal" immigrant until she receives 
her green card and the way things are now that could be a month from now or 5 years 
from now. 

Every day I work around 100's of illegal aliens and nothing happens to them.  They want 
to be here legally to work but CIS cannot seem to find a way to make it happen. 

I am totally for any government agency to be basically self supporting.  BUT  they must 
provide prompt and accurate service to their customers.  We customers have NO OTHER 
CHOICE but to us CIS so they have no incentive to provice service to us. 

If they were a private business they would go bankrupt in 3 months. They would lose 
their customers to other business's that would provide prompt and accurate service. 

Sincerely,
