Dear  Director:

I am most concerned about a proposal by the Citizenship  and Immigration  Service, the
division of the Department of Homeland Security, to nearly double the cost of becoming
an U.S. citizen and drastically  raise the cost of becoming  a legal permanent  resident.
According to the articles by the Associate Press issued on January 31, 2007, the bill
proposes to increase an application fee for citizenship from $330 to $595 and the fee for
becoming a legal permanent  resident from $325 to $905.

The proposal, if adopted, would affect the poor Southeast Asian refugees and
immigrants especially Cambodians in the United States.  It would  prevent several
hundred thousands  of Cambodians  who have already taken or will take steps toward
becoming US citizen or permanent residents from becoming one.

Lowell, MA would be disproportionately affected since it is home to the second-largest
community of Cambodian refugees in the United States.  According to the 2000 U.S
Census, the Southeast Asian population of Lowell totals 17,300.  It is believed that the
total Lowell's Southeast Asian population is seriously undercounted.  The Lowell City
officials  estimate the Southeast Asian population to be at least 32,000  most of who are
Cambodians. According to recent census data, the per capita income for the Lowell's
Cambodians is US$ 6,259; 42.6 % of the Lowell's Cambodians live below the Federal
Poverty Level; and only 46% of Lowell's Cambodians are in the workforce, in contrast to
the national average of 65%.

I hope you will seriously consider the impact that the proposal would have on our poor
Southeast Asians who would seek to become American citizen or permanent  residents.
Such the proposal can only prevent smooth integration of minority communities  into a
mainstream society, and seems to be contrary to an immigration  policy that  President
Bush well articulated in his state of the Union Address to the United States Congress on
Tuesday January 23, 2007.
