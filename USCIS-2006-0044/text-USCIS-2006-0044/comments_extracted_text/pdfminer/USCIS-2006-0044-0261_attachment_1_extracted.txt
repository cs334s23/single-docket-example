Subject: fee hike 

The fee hike is an excellent idea.  It would allow those that really want permanent visas or to 
become citizens, to do so much faster.  The fees haven't been raised in years.  Every other 
government function has increased their fees.  From driver's licenses, to car tags, to vehicle 
inspections, to court costs, etc.  It seems the only reasonable thing to do.
