Subject: Proposed I-171H Fees 

Document ID USCIS-2006-0044-0001 
DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 
Document Title: Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization  
Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule  

A am sending this e-mail to express my deep concern for the USCIS  
proposed plan for adjustment of the immigration and naturalization  
benefit application and petition fee schedule. My concern is  
specifically for the fees that will be increased that relate to  
international adoption. I am in the process of adopting a child from 
China, but the proposed rate increase of almost 66% will make it very  
difficult, if not impossible, for many families to adopt. Because many  
countries are taking longer to complete the adoption than the  
fingerprints and 171-H are valid, I must have these renewed,  
which causes me to have to pay the fees twice. It is already difficult 
 for families to pay for these fees twice, but with the proposed increases  
many families may no longer be able to afford to adopt, and many  
children around the world may never find a forever home. A home  
is something that every child deserves to have. I ask you to  
please reconsider raising these fees. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Erica Gilday
