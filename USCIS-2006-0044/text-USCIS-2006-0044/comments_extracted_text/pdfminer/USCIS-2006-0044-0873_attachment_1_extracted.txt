Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 

 I would like to oppose strongly the proposed rule of raising the processing fees of applications 
and petitions for International students. The implementation of this policy is unfair because this 
policy increases the fees without increasing the benefits of international students.
