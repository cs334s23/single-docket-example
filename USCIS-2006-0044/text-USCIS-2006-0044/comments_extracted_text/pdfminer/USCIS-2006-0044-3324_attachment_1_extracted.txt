 Director, Regulatory Management Division: 

I am an attorney practicing in the field of immigration law.   

One aspect of fee policy I would like to see changed is the motion to 
reopen fee.  People have to pay this fee even when it is service error. I 
think this fee should be refunded if it is service error, or to make 
things simple fee could be non-refundable, but keep it affordable! ($200 
or so) And one fee should be enough for whole family (for instance if 
princpal beneficiary has his I-485 denied a fee shouldn't be charged for 
each derivative family member whose I-485s are usually denied at the same 
time.) This could easily be done procedurally just by holding family 485 
denials in abeyance at least long enough for motion to reopen to be filed 
(and adjuciated if it is filed). 

My 2 cents. 

Sincerely, 

Allison  Wright
