Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Adjustment of the Immigration Benefit Application/ 
Petition and Biometric Fee Schedule  

I would like to comment on the proposed fee schedule adjustmen referred to above.  I used these 
services to apply for I171h; we are adopting a child from China.  Although I understand the need 
to raise costs as other costs rise, I feel this raise is too high.  The costs associated with an 
adoption are already expensive, and by making it more that is less families that will be able to 
apply and more children who are left homeless and orphaned.  It is also high especially if I have 
to reapply to have my I171h renewed because it may expire prior to the adoption.  Could there be 
a separate fee for renewals, since I'm sure that involves less paperwork??  What about making 
the time before expiration longer, at least 24 months? 

Thank you for hearing my comments.
