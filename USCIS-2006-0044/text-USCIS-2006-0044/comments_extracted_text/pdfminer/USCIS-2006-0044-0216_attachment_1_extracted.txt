Good Afternoon, 
I would like to state my comments by stating that I agree 100% with the new fees, but I would 
also like to inform that as well as the fees when up and the effort that was consider, we should 
also help those individuals who are trying to achieve the goals or change their status. I’m not 
asking the nation to prize the actions, but to give them a chance to make things RIGHT… the 
Illegal manner 
Please feel free to respond with feed back. Will be looking forward. 
Thank you
