Subject: Increases in citizenship applications 

To whom it may concern: 

I am writing in regard to the proposal that the U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (USCIS) has made to increase the citizenship 
application fee and the fee for permanent residency. 

These increases will make it even more difficult for individuals to apply 
for citizenship. The majority of these individuals are students and 
refugees: hard working individuals who are here because of oppression - they 
are people who are seeking hope for a new life.  As it is, many have not 
been able to afford the $400 to apply for citizenship. Under the proposal, 
the cost to file a citizenship application would go from $400 to $675, a 70% 
increase! Other filing fees would rise even more sharply: 

-to sponsor a fianc√© to immigrate, from $170 to $455! 
-to file to bring a close relative to the U.S. from $190 to $355! 
-to apply for a citizenship certificate for a child, from $330 to $595! 
And, to apply for permanent residency, from $325 to $905! 

I see this as only encouraging more people to come to the United States 
illegally, rather than going through the proper routes and spending the 
money to become legal citizens! Please don't allow this proposal to be 
approved! 

Thank you,
