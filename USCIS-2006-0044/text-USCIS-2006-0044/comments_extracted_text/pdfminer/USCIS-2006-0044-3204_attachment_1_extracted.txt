Adoptive Parent- Vicki Anderson 

I am writing in objection to the proposed fee increases for USCIS services.  These increases will 
make adoption even more expensive that it already is.  With the increase in fees all around, it 
could potentially cost adoptive families  $1500 more just for USCIS fees, an increase of 120-
140% above the current fees. 
This type of increase is preposterous.  When you multipy it by the number of families who adopt 
internationally each year it is unimaginable. 
Do not make a difficult and expensive journey to our children more unreachable.
