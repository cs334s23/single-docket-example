Please accept my recommendation regarding maintenance of the current fee structure for 
naturalization processes in the U.S. The increase poses a significant hardship to individuals who 
have been legally admitted to the U.S. and have set about to cooperate with U.S. expectations to 
become citizens of our country. For many the ability to earn and set aside the current fees is 
difficult and the additional amounts virtually impossible to accumulate. While the department of 
immigration budget concerns may be driving the increase in fees, the goals of the department are 
most effectively met by providing naturalization opportunity for persons who have immigrated and 
wish to become permanent U.S. citizens. I recommend alternate means be developed to address 
budget or other issues, means that enhance the relationship with the citizens-to-be and help them 
realize their hope of becoming citizens rather than pose an obstacle that for many is 
insurmountable. Thak you very much for accepting comments and recommendations on this 
issue.
