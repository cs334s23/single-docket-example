Subject: CIS proposed fee increase 

I am responding to the CIS proposal to raise filing fees in the near future.  These fee 
increases will impact adoption related petitions, and so will affect families wanting to 
adopt internationally and orphaned children waiting for homes.  As an adoption 
counselor, I witnessed almost half of my waiting families file their I-600A this past year 
for the second time.  As the wait time for processing and referral increases in 
international cases, many families are not able to complete their adoption in the 15/18 
month time mandated for refingerprinting or reapplication.  These fee increases will only 
further discourage families, who might otherwise be able to provide safe and loving 
homes for children, from inter-country adoption.  I strongly encourage maintaining 
current fees in the interest of finding homes for children.  Thank you.  Pat Cimino, MS
