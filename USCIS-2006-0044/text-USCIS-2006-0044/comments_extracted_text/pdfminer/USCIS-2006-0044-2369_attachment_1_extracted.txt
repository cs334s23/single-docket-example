Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To USCIS officials, 

I  AM WRITING TO STATE THAT THE SCHEDULED FEE ADJUSTMENT IS 
COMPLETELY WRONG AT SUCH AN INCREASE!!! 

I UNDERSTAND THAT INCREASES IN FEES FOR IMMIGRATION VISAS MUST 
BE MADE, BUT THE INCREASE YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS WAY ABOVE 
WHAT IS FAIR TO THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY ARE U.S CITZENS.   

I AM IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING FROM CHINA AND THE WAIT TIME IS 
INCREASING. THEREFORE, I WILL HAVE TO RE-APPY FOR MY 
FINGERPRINTING AND CLEARANCE AT LEAST 2 TIMES , MAYBE EVEN 3.  

PLEASE BE REASONABLE IN YOUR FEE ADJUSTMENTS. 

RESPECTFULLY, A CONCERNED CITIZEN OF THE USA 

SHARON D. BIZAR,
