Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I wanted to voice my concern that the fees for international adoption related processing are going up.  
International adoption is outrageously expensive as it is, and these fees amount to an enormous increase in 
the burden on families just trying to create a home.  I hope that you reconsider these increases. 

Best wishes,
