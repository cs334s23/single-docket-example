Dear Sir or Madam: 

Your proposal to raise I-600 and N-600 fees by over 20% is patently ridiculous.  Please note: 

1)  Your proposed fee structure takes into account refugee fees and fee waivers, nneither of 
which apply to these types of documents. 
2)  Your proposed fees exceed the actual cost projections for these documents. 

International adoption is an expensive proposition.  Your proposal to raise fees places an 
excessive burden on prospective parents attempting to save the lives of children.  Shame on you!
