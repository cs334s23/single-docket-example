I am writing today to oppose the increase in the I-600, I-600A and 171-H fee increase.  
About 10,000 of us each year in the process of adopting thru China, and many working 
with other countries where the legal process takes more than 18 months,  already have to 
pay to re-fingerprint when those expire and then later, redo our Homestudy to resubmit 
the whole I-600/I-600A when it expires, and maybe bay to redo fingerprints again, 
because the time limit is too short for our process.  This represents Thousands of 
dollars, and processing this same paperwork over four times, for families who just want a 
chance to be parents.  It seems to make more sense to make our 171-H's good for 30 
months, especially considering the cost/manpower involved in obtaining it in the first 
place.  We are families who vote- many families who vote, with aunts uncles, 
grandparents who will hear about this issue.  Many are struggling to pay all of the fees in 
our 2+ year process, so that we can bring our children home.  Our government should be 
assisting us as we work together to meet all the legal and moral obligations, not throwing 
up bureaucratic road blocks that take more time and money.  Please consider this.  Thank 
you,
