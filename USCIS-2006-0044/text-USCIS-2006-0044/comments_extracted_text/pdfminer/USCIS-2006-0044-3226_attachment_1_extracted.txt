To the Department of Homeland Security,  

I'm writing to protest the proposed fee increases for immigrants.  It seems to me that 
such a huge increase in fees punish immigrants who follow the rules and who want become a 
permanent part of the United States.   

An increase of 66% is extremely prohibitive for many people.  I, personally, am saving my 
money for a down payment for a house.  If suddenly I had to save 66% more than the 
amount I'm planning on, I would most likely have to give up my dream to own a home.  I fear 
that such large fee increases will make this e the case for many immigrants, as well.  

I know that the argument has been made that people have still applied for green cards and 
citizenship after other fee increases in the past.  But that doesn't mean that it's the same 
people who would have applied had the fees stayed the same.  Sure, if the fees go up, people 
will still apply.  But for some immigrants, this fee increase will forever cut off their dreams 
of becoming U.S. citizens.  I teach many immigrants, and most don't have money to spare.  
They work very hard and for very long hours and very low wages.  And many families are 
trying to afford citizenship for several family members at the same time.  The proposed 
costs are very prohibitive for them.  

I feel that DHS should either ask Congress for a yearly allotment of funds for the 
department to do its job in a way that doesn't put such an unfair burden on immigrants.   

I also think that if an increase does have to happen, it should occur in stages, not all at 
once.   If an increase were added in stages, or if an increase were announced for a year or 
two in the future, then permanent residents could have time to study for the citizenship 
exam and pass it before the fees increased.  But many people are not in a position to file for 
citizenship in the next few months before fees go up because they need more time to work 
on their English and prepare for the test.  

In addition to punishing people becoming citizens, people who want to become Lawful 
Permanent Residents are truly being hurt by the upfront fees of $905.  Many middle-class 
natural born citizens could not come up with that kind of money, and certainly many 
immigrants cannot.  

In conclusion, I hope that the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services do whatever they can to get funding from other sources and either 
reject the proposed fee increases or severely limit them to perhaps a 10 or 15% increase -- 
not 66%! 

Sincerely,
