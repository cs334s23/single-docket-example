Thank you for giving the opportunity to give my comment on the new 21st immigration 
service. I think adjusting the fee will be reasonable if it serves immigrants in a fair and 
timely manner. The problem I have with the current service is the back log in processing 
applications. For me personally it is affecting my marriage because I have been waiting 
for a while to be united with my husband.Since my husband is permanent resident it takes 
longer to process the application than an applicant who is an American citizen.  

If the adjustment if the fee improves and accelerates processing applications I totally 
support it. 

Best Regards
