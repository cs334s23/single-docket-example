Dear Sir or Madam, 
I am writing to beg you to reject the proposed increase in fees for processing the 
following services and forms: I-600/I-600A, N-565, N-600, and biometrics services.  My 
husband and I are in the process of adopting a baby from China.  We have been unable to 
have biological children after years of trying to get pregnant.  International adoption is 
proving to be a wonderful option for us.  However, it is an extremely expensive option.  
We estimate we will spend $20,000-$25,000 by the time we bring our baby home.  Please 
do not add to the financial burden by increasing the USCIS fees.  Many adopting families 
already bear so many financial burdens as they sacrifice and scrape together the money to 
expand their families.  For many of us, there is the emotional agony of waiting an 
extended period of time for our child to be referred to us following years of infertility.  
China is so behind in referring children that we expect to have to re-file the I-600A form 
and get fingerprinted again because our first set of paperwork and fingerprints likely will 
expire before we travel abroad.  If you've never experienced infertility or if you have 
never adopted, if you grew your family without difficulties, please take a moment to put 
yourself in our shoes.  Given all that we go through in fulfilling our unending hope of 
having children, the least you can do is keep the fees for USCIS paperwork and services 
where they are currently...especially for people like us who may end up filing twice 
because of the long wait.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  We also appreciate 
your prayers for our family as we continue on this journey. 

Sincerely and respectfully, 
Missy in Missouri
