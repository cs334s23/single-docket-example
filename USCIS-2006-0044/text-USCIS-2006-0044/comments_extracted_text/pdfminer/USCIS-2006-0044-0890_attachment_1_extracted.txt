Subject: [Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044];[FR Doc: E7-01631];[Page 4887-4915]; Immigration: 
Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am requesting that you do not increase the cost of the fingerprinting and I-600 
fees.  I currently have an I-171 approving my adoption in China, however, due 
to unforeseen delays in China, more than likely I will have to redo (and repay) 
the fingerprinting and I-600 fees even though my circumstances regarding my 
ability to adopt will not change.   

I have great concerns that even though the fees may increase, that there is no 
mention in the docket that the individual USCIS offices will improve the speed 
of processing orphan petitions.  In fact, the Jacksonville, Florida branch 
considers the orphan petitions as a collateral duty, therefore, there is much 
delay in processing even though I pay the same fees as other Americans do 
using other branch offices. 

Please do not penalize and take advantage of adoptive parents-to-be in 
situations like mine since there are no fast-tracking or renewal process for 
adopting orphans.  You are more than welcome to email me directly if you 
have any further questions or concerns.   

Sincerely, 
Amy Schreck 
Jacksonville, Florida
