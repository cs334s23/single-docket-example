Dear USCIS, 

I, _Megan Guimon, am deeply concerned with the proposed increase in the 
application fee for U.S. citizenship and other immigration benefits. 

I believe that USCIS should find a solution that promotes, rather than 
discourages, immigrant integration.  I believe the fee increase would 
discourage low-income legal immigrants from pursuing permanent resident 
status and citizenship.  This is clearly a strike against integration 
efforts.  Encouraging integration is in national interest because it 
strengthens national security.  Inviting and involving immigrants in our 
societyâ€™s public institutions is good for our nation. 

The United States is a nation that is strengthened by the contributions of 
newcomers of all backgrounds.  Raising the obstacles to integration goes 
against this legacy. 

Finally, I believe the cost of processing immigration and naturalization 
benefit applications and petitions should NOT be on the backs of 
prospective immigrants. I believe Congress should appropriate money for 
technology and infrastructure improvements at USCIS. 

Sincerely, 

Megan Guimon
