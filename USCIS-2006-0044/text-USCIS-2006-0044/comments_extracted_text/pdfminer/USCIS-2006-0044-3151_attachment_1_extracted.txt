Subject: proposed petition fees 

We would like to ask that the USCIS reconsider raising their fees so dramatically on 
adoption related petitions. Adoption costs are already extremely costly, as is well known. 
Please do not hike the fees at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, docket number 
(USCIS-2006-0044) by such a steep amount, especially on the Application for Certificate 
of Citizenship, a 66% jump. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Mr. & Mrs. 
Allen Pate
