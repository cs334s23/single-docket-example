Subject: fees 

         As a Family Support Worker with immigrant families who are at the bottom levels of income, 
I wonder how they are expected to raise these exaggerated fees. Beside, USCIS has failed 
behind in it is work not because of lack of funding but of lack of accountability and oversight by 
Feds. How then, could you, Mr. Gonzales explain why American citizens who already paid fees 
wait 6 years just for their application processed? I had applied for my wifeâ€™s petition on March 5, 
2005, and nothing had been done about it to this day. It is costing me a lot of money to go to 
Kenya and get back to Seattle every other time. I think it is unrealistic to increase fees. It could 
only be construed as discouraging people from applying for US visa.   
Hoping to convince you to reverse these decisions of unrealistic fees 
 Thank you.
