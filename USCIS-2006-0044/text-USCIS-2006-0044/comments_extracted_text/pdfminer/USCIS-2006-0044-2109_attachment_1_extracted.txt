 Director, Regulatory Management Division: 

I am the directing attorney at the International Institute of Boston. The 
people that we serve are all low-moderate income. Most of our clients do 
not qualify for fee waivers and, yet, struggle to pay the current fees 
with USCIS. The fee increase will cause extreme hardships for many of our 
working class families. I understand the need for the Service to resolve 
fiscal issues. However, passing the costs on to these hardworking, low 
income people is unjust. There must be another solution. I beg you to look 
and work for other options. 

Sincerely, 

Thomas Gildea
