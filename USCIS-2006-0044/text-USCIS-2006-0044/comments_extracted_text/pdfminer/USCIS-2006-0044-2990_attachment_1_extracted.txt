Subject: Docket #: USCIS- 2006-0044 Immigration: Benefit application fee schedule 

I am an adoptive parent of a child from China.  I went through many more governmental “hoops” 
than non adoptive parents to have a child.  While I understand the desire of our government to be 
thorough and I understand that I must pay fees for your services, I request that you do not 
increase these fees.  Adoption is a long, sometimes frustrating, expensive and always rewarding 
process.  Please do not further burden adoptive parents with additional fees.  The adoption fees 
may already be prohibitive to some families and an increase may further reduce the number of 
families that could otherwise provide a child with a good, safe, and loving home.  

Thank you for your consideration
