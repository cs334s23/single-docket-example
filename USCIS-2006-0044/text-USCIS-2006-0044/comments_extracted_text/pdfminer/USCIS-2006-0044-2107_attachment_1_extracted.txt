Subject: USCIS-2006-0044: DO NOT INCREASE FEES 

The fee increases are too steep.  You need to consider incremental adjustments.  It's very unfair 
to just pump the fees up that way.  Very inhumane.  You said you need to adjust to be able to 
serve better.  You've always used that as a reason and year after year the services never got 
better.  Most importantly, Congress needs to appropriate some money to these services.  Why 
don't you advocate this to the Congress?  The nation benefits from immigrants.  Our economy 
stays strong.  The housing market is strong.  Immigrants buy houses and pay for services.  
Immigrants bring in the brain and the brawn.  Let's face the reality.  Congress' approach to the 
funding of USCIS is clearly based on racism.  We will spend unlimited amount to round them up 
and kick them out but we don't spend money to bring them here and have them contribute to our 
economy.  What a farce. 

But bottom line, you can't increase fees in the manner you propose.  Look at the way the USPS is 
proposing fee increases.  Learn from the good practices.  Overall this kind of action is so 
indicative of the hubris of this administration!
