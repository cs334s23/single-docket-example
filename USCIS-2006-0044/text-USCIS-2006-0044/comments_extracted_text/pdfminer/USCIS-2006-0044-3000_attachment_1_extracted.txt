Dear Director of Regulatory Management Division: 

RE:  DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

We, the undersigned, strongly oppose the increased fee schedule proposed by US Citizenship and 
Immigration Services WSCIS) on February 1,2007.  The fee increases are alarming and detrimental to 
low income immigrant families, e.g., an increase fiom $330 to $595 (not counting $80 for biometries) 
for Naturalization, $190 to $290 for Rene~vlReplace Permanent Resident Card, $190 to $355 for 
Petition for Alien Relative, and $325 to $905 for Adjustment of Status to Permanent Resident. 

USCIS claims that they need the fee increases to cover costs.  However, we fumly believe that there are 
many ways to cover costs of USCIS operations.  Contracting with not-for-profit conununi@-based 
organizations to process applications through an open bidding process would solve the issue of a high 
cost operation.  Elimination of unnecessary applications and bureaucracy would be cost effective. 
Perhaps there is a need to review all of the application forms to see whether they are necessary.  For 
example, is it a must to renew permanent resident cards?  Could USCIS issue citizenship certificates to 
children at the time when their parent is naturalized without having to apply for a certificate (N-600)? 

We request that you reconsider such a drastic increase of immigration fees. 

Thank you for your attention and assistance. 

Sincerely yours,
