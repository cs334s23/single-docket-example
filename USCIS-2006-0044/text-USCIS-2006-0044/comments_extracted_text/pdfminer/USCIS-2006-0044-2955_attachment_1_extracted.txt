Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

We are currently in the process of adopting a child from China.  We have had to pay the fees for 
our daughterâ€™s petition one time already.  With the increased wait times, we stand a strong 
chance of having to renew our paperwork at least one more time.  The fee increase will 
substantially increase our adoption fees that are already upwards of $25,000.00.  These fees 
should not only remain the same but also should be amended for renewal purposes.  These 
children are true orphans and deserve to be in loving homes.  Fee increases will surely deter 
average income families from realizing their dream of having children. 

Thanks for your consideration in this matter. 

Sincerely, 

HOPE and LANCE WALLACE
