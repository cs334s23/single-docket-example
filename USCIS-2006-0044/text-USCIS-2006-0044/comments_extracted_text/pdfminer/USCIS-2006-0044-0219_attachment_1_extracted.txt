Subject: fee hike 

Although I realize the practical, simple way of collecting dues for citizenship applications is 
through monetary requirements, I don’t feel this is an accurate way of determining who is most 
deserving of citizenship or green card status.  Often those that work the hardest and contribute 
the most to our economy are the poorest.  Why not propose another sort of “fee” or requirement – 
community service?  Of course many logistics and checks and balances would have to be worked 
out to determine this in not abused and individuals are not taken advantage of, but I feel that as a 
whole, our society would benefit more if individuals were given the option of demonstrating their 
desire for citizenship or green card status through other means.  This could be a more accurate 
way of ensuring individuals applying to be more formally integrated into our society are committed 
and deserving of such privilege.
