I think the filing fee increase is problematic considering the level of customer service currently 
being 
provided by USCIS, and the current backlogs.  

Customer service is not easily accessible. DHS  Employees are rude, distant and not helpful. If 
the consumer is spending money on a SERVICE they should get timely, friendly helpful service. 
Charging more and getting less is 
typical for this agency.  

MONEY is not “THE ISSUE” in my opinion its Institutional Bureaucracy, lack of accountability and 
oversight. Money cannot cure what is wrong with Immigration Services.
