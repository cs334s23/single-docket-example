Sub: Request to reconsider on proposed fee increase for I485 Application 

Respected Director, 

I reviewed the proposed increase in fee for various applications in Docket No: USCIS-
2006-0044. I will be commenting on application fee proposed for I485 which is almost 
tripled from $325 to $905 

I strongly beleive and feel that this fee increase would ONLY be justifiable if the 
PROCESSING TIME FOR I485 is decreased by a factor of three. 
For my case, I will have to wait for ATLEAST 3 years before I get my Green Card. 
ONLY if the processing time decreases to one year would this fee increase is justifiable. 

I hope you give due consideration before implementing the proposed fee increase. 

Sincerely, 
Non-Immigrant
