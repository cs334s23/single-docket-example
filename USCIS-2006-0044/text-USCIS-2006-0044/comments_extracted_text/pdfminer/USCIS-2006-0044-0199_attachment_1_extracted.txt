Hello, 

I am intending to voice my approval for the proposed fee increase. The 
immigrant who benefits from coming to the US should pay his/her own costs - 
not the American taxpayer. 

The group who should be the first to pay are "Guest Workers" who gain the 
greatest advantage and depress wages. It is not the obligation of any US 
taxpayer to assist, financially or otherwise, an immigrant who is coming 
here to enjoy a better life... 

Respectfully,
