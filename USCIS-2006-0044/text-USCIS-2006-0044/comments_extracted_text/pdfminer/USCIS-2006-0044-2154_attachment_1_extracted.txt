Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

In reference to USCIS-2006-0044, please do not pass the proposed fee increases. Thousands of children are 
denied a safe loving home simply because many families can't afford to enter the adoption arena. Raising 
these fees so substantially will only serve to deny more children homes.
