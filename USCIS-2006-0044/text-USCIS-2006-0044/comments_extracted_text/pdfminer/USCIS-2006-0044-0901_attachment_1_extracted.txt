To whom it may concern, 

It had been brought to my attention that an increase in the fee for the 
I-600A is being considered.  I urge you not to go through with this.  
As it is the wait time to adopt from China has increased and we have to 
redo our I-600A  because the I-171H covers such a short amount of time. 
So this increase doubly effects those adopting from China.  
The cost involved in adopting is so large that many children are denied 
families because the cost scares away those parents who would love to 
bring a child into their lives via adoption.  We are not rich.  We are 
people who want to bring a child into our lives. 
Please do not be a part of the problem.  Please do what is right. 
Please make us proud of you. 
With GREAT HOPE, 
James & Donna Miller
