Re:  DHS Docket No. USCIS 2006-0044  

Dear Director:  

I'm writing to convey my strong opposition to the proposal by the U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services to increase the fees for starting the naturalization process. This proposed 
fee hike of 69% is punitive to hardworking newcomers wishing to become U.S. citizens.  

I am a native of Arizona living in a small and rural community of Patagonia located 15 miles from 
the U.S. Mexico border.  I also serve on my local school board, Patagonia Elementary School 
District #6.  I know the difficulty that families are going through to make ends meet while saving 
money for the family naturalization applicatio process.  I volunteer at our local church thrift shop 
once a month and know the shop helps many families who have very limited resources.  

I do not oppose applicants paying a fee to apply for U.S. citizenship, but oppose the exorbitant 
increase in the fee.  Our nation has a tradition of welcoming newcomers because of their 
contributions to our economic and social progress.  The USCIS' proposed fee increase is contrary 
to the spirit of this tradition and sends newcomers the wrong message at a time when they are 
seeking to embrace U.S. citizenship.  I urge you to halt the proposed naturalization fee increase, 
and seek appropriated funding to help cover the investments the USCIS needs to provide quality 
services at an affordable price.  

I thank you for your consideration and attention to my request.  

Sincerely,  

Cynthia Matus Morriss
