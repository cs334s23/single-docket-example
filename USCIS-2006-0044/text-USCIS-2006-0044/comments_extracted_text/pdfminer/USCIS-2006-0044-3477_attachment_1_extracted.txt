 Director, Regulatory Management Division: 

As an immigration paralegal, I have significant experience with the 
immigration process.   I am appalled by the Service's proposal to 
radically increase its fees.  

1. Individuals are already having a difficult time to pay high filing fees 
to receive a benefit.  The United States of America is a country of 
immigrants. 

2. Many of the forms listed in your rulemaking are filed at the Service 
Centers and do not get adjudicated by District Offices. Therefore, it is 
unreasonable to include District Office times into the fees. 

3. If background checks are being done by the FBI and local police forces, 
why is the USCIS charging an additional fee for this? 

4. Increasing I-485 fees to include I-131 and I-765 fees:  There are many 
instances where our clients only submit the Form I-485.  These clients 
either have valid H-1B or L-1 visas or they are not eligible for the Form 
I-131 filing.  Making it mandatory for these individuals to have to pay 
for benefits they will not use is not correct or fair. 

In sum, the Service has failed to justify these fee increases and the 
whole proposal should be withdrawn and reconsidered. 

Sincerely, 

Adrienne Chula
