Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I began my adoption process in January of 2006.  The fees for processing my I 
600 A had just increased.  Now there is a proposal to increase the fees again by 
66%.  I am adopting from China.  The wait has increased significantly and I will 
have to resubmit my paperwork again as they will expire before I get my referral.  
Adoption fees are high anyways but increasing the fees would make it even more 
expensive.  It will cost me close to $1500 to redo this paperwork (and I am a 
single person) and this is without the increase in fees.  The increase in fees will 
make adoption less of an option for many people who cannot afford this extra 
increase. The increase will hurt a lot of us who are waiting.  This community is 
very large and is already hanging our heads down because our wait times have 
greatly increased since when initially applied to the program.  Don't keep kicking 
us while we are down.  Don't make international adoption available to the upper 
classes.  Don't increase the fees.
