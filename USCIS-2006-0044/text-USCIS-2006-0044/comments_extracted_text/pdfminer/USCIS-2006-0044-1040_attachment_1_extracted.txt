Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

I wish to express my strong opposition to the proposed fee increases by the U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). I strongly feel that the increased fee 
proposal is excessive and will continue to block individuals seeking to adjust their 
immigration status.
The proposed fee increases will place too heavy a burden on the backs of immigrants; 
thus denying them their dreams of becoming American citizens or preventing them from 
reuniting with their families. This dramatic increase goes counter to the administration 
effort to help immigrants become citizens of the United States.  

The administration has made the democratic inclusion of immigrants one of its most 
prominent public messages. Dropping the proposed fee increases would add credibility to 
these public statements and also support immigrants in their efforts to contribute to the 
nation’s vibrancy and future.

Again, this economic barrier will diminish many people’s hope to become permanent 
residents or citizens and/or to be reunited with their family members. I eagerly await your 
response.
