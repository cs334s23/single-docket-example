Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

We are currently in the adoption process.  (adopting from China)  We 
were originally in the traditional program, but had considered and 
applied to our agency for special needs as well.  In addition, with the 
ever increasing time frame, documents have already had to be done a 
second time.  Adoption is such an expensive option anyway, these 
increases are very difficult for people to manage - once, much less 
twice. 

We have paid for a home study update, new fingerprints, and, because we 
found our daughter on another ageny listing of waiting children, have 
also had to pay another agency fee. 

These children desperately need homes and loving families, and the more 
fees increase, the fewer families will be able to bring the love of a 
forever family to these children. 

Please make the well being of these children a primary focus, and know 
that God considers children a blessing, and debt a curse. 

Blessings,
