Subject: Form N-400 fee increase 

To Whom it may concern: 

I have been working with the citizenship program and provide information to the 
Southeast Asia refugees and permanence resident live in Minnesota for many years.   
These new people can not even effort to pay their form N-400 application fee to become 
a US citizen.   Because the majority these refugees are low income families or poo rs.  If 
USCIS increase form N-400 fee to $675, then it will be even harder for refugees and 
other permanence residents to apply their US citizenship.  I hope that all the elective 
officials will consider their citizens voter was important and also elected them to help 
their citizen need.  

Sincerely your,  

Txong Pao Lee
