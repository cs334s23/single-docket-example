Subject: Comments re: USCIS-2006-0044 

I am most concerned with the proposed fee increase for the required USCIS paperwork for 
adoptive families.  International adoption is incredibly expensive.  We know families who have the 
heart to adopt, but don't have the finances to do it.  Due to delays in our international adoption of 
two siblings, we have already had to re-file and re-fingerprint twice.  This also means we have 
paid the fees twice which are already expensive without the fee increase.   

We have already waited several weeks for our paperwork to be processed for re-approval.  Will 
the fee increase ensure we have a better quality of service and faster processing? 

It is our desire to provide homes to orphans.  These children need our help and we need to do all 
we can to encourage other families to adopt them. Please keep the CIS fees to a minimum and 
speed up the process to get our approvals so we can provide loving homes to these wonderful 
children.  As fees increase, fewer and fewer families will be able to consider an international 
adoption, and the children will suffer. 

Sincerely, 
M. Idle
