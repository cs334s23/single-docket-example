Hi the DHS Officer, my name is Thin Thin Swe. I would like to oppose the immigration application 
fees increase. It would be an extra burden for the new immigrant coming here and wanting to 
reunite with their family members back home since people who are recently here do not have 
high paid income. 

Thank you very much, 
Thin Thin Swe.
