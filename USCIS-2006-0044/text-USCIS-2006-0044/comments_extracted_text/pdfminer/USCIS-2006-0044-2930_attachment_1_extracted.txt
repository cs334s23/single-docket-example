RE:  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
        Docket number USCIS-2006- 0044 

Dear Sir/Madame: 

Please reconsider increasing fees for adoption petitions.  I understand that there is an expense 
for processing immigration paperwork for adoption purposes, but please do not raise these fees. 
 It is very expensive to finalize an international adoption and the strain on the adoptive family is 
already great enough.  We are not all wealthy contrary to some persons beliefs. 

My family is in the process of adopting an older child from Colombia, one of the forgotten kids 
who so desperately deserves a chance at life.  The adoptions take time, and we are now having 
to update our I-600A paperwork due to time delays.  I know that we are not the only ones, and 
please donâ€™t make adoptions cost prohibitive for families who may have to apply more than once 
to remain current. 

Thank you for your consideration.  Hopefully you can find needed income in other places without 
jeopardizing the lives of these children. 

Terri and David Luttrell 
Austin, Tx
