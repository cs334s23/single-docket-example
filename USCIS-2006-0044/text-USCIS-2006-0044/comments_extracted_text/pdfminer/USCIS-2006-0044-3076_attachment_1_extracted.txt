Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit  
Application and Petition Fee Schedule 

I am against the proposed hike in fees by the U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Sevices as 
it relates to naturalizing adopted children.  Is the U.S. simply looking for ways to off-set 
its monolithic budget deficits each year?  This is not the way to go about doing it, by 
nickle and diming families who are seeking to adopt children.  What sort of message does 
this send about our view on growing families? 

Is this to somehow send a message to the world to stop immigrating to the United States?  
If so, this is ridiculous.  To encourage "legal" immigration, wouldn't we want to lower 
fees, not raise them? 

I am against USCIS-2006-0044.
