I have been recently reading regarding the increase in fees.  I would 
not be opposed to the increase if it meant that the documents were 
valid for a longer time period.  Presently, those of us who are 
adopting from China are finding that our documents are expiring before 
we can complete the adoption.  Most of us are having to repeat our 
fingerprints and our I 171 h.  Please take this into consideration when 
you are looking to greatly increase the fees. 

Sincerely, 
Dawn Rittenhouse
