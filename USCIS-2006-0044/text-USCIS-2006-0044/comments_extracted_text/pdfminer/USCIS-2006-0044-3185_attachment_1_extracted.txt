Subject: Docket: USCIS-2006-0044 

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: 

Regarding Docket USCIS-2006-0044 proposes to increase international adoption fees by about 
66%.  It  appears to be an overly zealous effort to use economics as a barrier to international 
adoptions.  I beg you to reconsider such an action.  There are children whose lives are in 
jeopardy- right now - and who are waiting to be rescued by loving and caring parents in the 
United States.  

If it becomes necessary, for some justifiable reason, to increase application and processing 
fees, then do so.  However, those who have previously paid for application and processing fees 
should not be subjected to a "double charge" for a single process.  That, I am afraid, is a dubious 
exploitation of a delicate situation where American citizens are, literally, at the mercy of a 
government agency.  Being at the mercy of your agency can make sense only if mercy is to be 
found among you. 

American families reaching out to make a difference in the world should be supported by their 
government, not discouraged.  Furthermore, raising fees by 66% and double-billing those who 
have already applied and paid sends a rather ominous message:  "WE DON'T REALLY CARE 
ABOUT CHILDREN."  Somehow, that seems to conflict with the declared philosophy of our 
nation. 

To do the right thing, use your knowledge and authority to protect American people from being 
gouged the first time around and/or double-billed when a law change pulls the carpet out from 
under them.  I pray that I can trust your deep and abiding love for the United States of America to 
guide you wisely on this matter. 

Thank you, 

Ben Dati
