Department of Homeland Security

DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

I am writing to express my full support for the proposed increase in the immigration and 
naturalization benefit application and petition fee schedule.  This fee increase is long 
overdue and the revenue generated will allow your agency to provide more efficient and 
effective services to the legal immigrant community you serve. 

I was very surprised to read that pro-illegal immigration organizations like the National 
Council of La Raza and pro-illegal immigration elected officials like Senator Ted 
Kennedy are opposed to the fee increase.  The fees charged for your processing related 
expenses are quite reasonable, even with the proposed fee increase, and should not 
burden any legal immigrant serious about coming to the United States. 

The USCIS is an important agency for the screening of those who wish to immigrate to 
the United States.  This fee increase will help strengthen our national security and 
enhance public safety (by weeding out criminals and terrorists) while at the same time 
providing better customer service to your agency’s clientele.  It’s a positive and needed 
action by our Federal Government and I support it.   

Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information. 

Sincerely, 

Brad Botwin
