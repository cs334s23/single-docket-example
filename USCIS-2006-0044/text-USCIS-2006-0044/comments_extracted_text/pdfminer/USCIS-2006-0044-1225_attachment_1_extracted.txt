Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

These proposed increases are excessive and will create yet another obstacle for 
individuals seeking to adjust their immigration status. The proposed fee increases will 
place too heavy a burden on the backs of immigrants, many of whom cannot shoulder the 
excessive costs and will be forced to postpone their dreams of becoming U.S. citizens or 
remain separated from their families.  

The size of the proposed fee increases is particularly troubling since the Bush 
administration has indicated that it wants to help immigrants become U.S. citizens. For 
example, the current fee to apply for permanent residency is $325; CIS proposes to raise 
this fee to $905 (a 178 percent increase). The fee for naturalization (“citizenship”) 
applications would increase from $330 to $595 (an 80 percent increase). These exorbitant 
fees would create undue economic hardship for many applicants and their family 
members.  

This is not the answer to the U.S.'s immigration problems.  Why not find an alternative 
that does not have a disparate economic impact?  Please decline to support this proposed 
legislation. 

Thank you,
