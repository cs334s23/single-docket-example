Subject: Notice of Proposed Rule Making 

I am writing to protest the proposed increase in filing fees for foreign adoptions (docket number 
USCIS-2006-0044).  

International adoption is expensive enough as it is, especially given the travel expense in addition 
to the fees required by our government.  The rules and timelines are confusing, and trying to get 
an answer or an update from the USCIS is like trying to penetrate a concrete wall at times.   Will 
the increase in fees guarantee the American public more efficient and customer-oriented (i.e. 
FRIENDLY/HELPFUL!) service?  If not, then this proposal is practically criminal.   

Discrepancies in the system, such as contradictory expiration dates of 171H's (18 months) and 
mandatory fingerprinting (15 months), need to be rectified and they are not for the American 
people to pay.  Just how does the above example make sense or make the process efficient?  It 
doesn't!  It only makes a difficult process more arduous and expensive for adoptive parents to 
manage.  

With Hague ratification coming in 2007, international adoption will likely become more expensive 
and less of an option for many US families.  Sadly, with the majority of waiting children in the 
US system so "broken," international adoption is the only viable choice for many of us to build 
healthy families through adoption (as so many children available abroad are due to poverty 
versus abuse, which seems so rampant in the US).   

Thank you for your considerations,
