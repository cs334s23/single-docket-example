Reponse to the docket no.: USCIS-2006-0044 

As a U.S. Citizen and a teacher of  adult immigrants, I strongly oppose the 
fee increases as proposed. The fee increases are too steep to be implemented 
as proposed. It is economically unreasonable for many immigrants to be able 
to afford the average 66% increase of services within a short period of 
time. I think government funds should be appropriated for some of the cost 
to upgrade the USCIS department and not use the fee-based system to pay for 
these upgrades. 

Also, I feel the USCIS did not do an adequate job informing the public of 
the proposed fee increases; and, therefore, may lack the needed feedback to 
implement the changes as is. I found the information on the fee increases 
not easy to read, and definitely not accessible to English as Second 
Language learners  who will ultimately be the ones being required to pay the 
fee increases.
