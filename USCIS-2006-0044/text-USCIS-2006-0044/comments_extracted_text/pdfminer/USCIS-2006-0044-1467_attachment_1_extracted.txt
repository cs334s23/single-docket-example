I ask that you not increase the fees for immigration. I do not believe 
that will solve any of our immigration problems. It might solve a few of 
your budget problems but I doubt that as well. 

I understand that you would use the additional fees to improve the 
efficiency of processing the fees, but then cost of the fees should go 
down. Just invest some money ahead of time and reduce your costs, then 
you won't have to increase the fees in the first place. 

I understand that the degree of difficulty of attaining immigration 
status in the first place is extraordinary, it doesn't need an 
additional financial burden. America was built on the backs of hard 
working immigrants...and we can rebuild our failing infrastructures in 
the same way.
