Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Hi, I just wanted to send my comments about the proposed increase in fees for adoption 
applications/form such as the I-600A and other related documents.  We would really appreciate it 
if the fees would not be increased.  Adoption is so expensive, new fees and requirements keep 
cropping up.  If the fees could be kept the same, you would be helping more families be able to 
afford adoption. 

Thank you for considering, 

Kara and Jeremy Eisenga
