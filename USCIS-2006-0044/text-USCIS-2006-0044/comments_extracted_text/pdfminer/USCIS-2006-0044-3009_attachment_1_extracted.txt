Dear Sir or Madame, 

I strongly urge you to reconsider USCIS' proposed fee increases because these increases 
will be detrimental to low income immigrant families and will place an extreme hardship 
on elderly immigrants, refugees, and asylees.  The proposed fee changes will increase the 
fee for Naturalization fiom $330 to $595 (not counting $80 for biometrics). for renewal 
or replacement of a Permanent Resident card from $1 90 to $290,  and the application 
filing fee for permanent residency fiom $325 to $905.  These are impossible amounts for 
low income families and especially for elderly  applicants, who have few prospects for 
emp1o)ment or income generation. 

As one Bosnian asylee stated, "I came here with my ten fingers and empty pockets."  His 
story is illustrative: 

"I  came here because I would have been forced by the police to be commander of a 
concentration camp.  I was given 24 hours to leave my country.  I had a nice job at a 
very high level in the military.  I had two houses and a very comfortable life.  When I 
came here, I was like a homeless person.  I started here in my  60's with a job cleaning 
toilets.  I felt so bad.  I started to work immediately because I didn't  want any help.  I 
wanted to show how I can work and survive.  I rejected charity.  For ten years, I 
worked 365 days, no weekends or holidays, to eam my pension.  Then the company 
told me that because I am not a citizen, my pension is just %350/month. I got a green 
card just last year when I am  75.  Now I have to wait four years to become a citizen." 

We ask that you take the following measures: 

Ask Congress to appropriate funds to USCIS so that the fee structure can be set 
within the means of immigrants, refugees, and asylees.  USCIS'  role in 
maintaining national security is vital and worthy of taxpayer support. 

Include asylees among those who will pay no fee when filing Form 1-485, the 
application for permanent resident status.  As proposed, USCIS'  fee increases 
exempt refugees, but not asy-lees. 

Allow elderly immigrants, refugees, and asylees to take the naturalization test in 
their first language regardless of how long they have resided in the United States. 

On behalf of our clients, I sincerely thank you for your time and consideration, 

Elisabeth O'Grady 
Executive Director
