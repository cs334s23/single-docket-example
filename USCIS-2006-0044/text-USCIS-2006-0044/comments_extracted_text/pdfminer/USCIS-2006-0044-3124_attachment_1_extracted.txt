Subject: USCIS Fee Increased Comment DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 

DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 

To Whom it May Concern: 

I am opposed to the proposed USCIS Fee increase because I believe that it would provide 
a disincentive for immigrants to step out of the shadows and access a legal path to 
citizenship. 

While services may need to be improved at USCIS, the burden should not have to be 
born on the back of immigrants who often times are struggling economically, are 
seperated from their families, and are trying to maintain a decent lifestyle.  

In a country which contributes so many tax cuts to big business, the cost of 
immigration should be borne by big business, and not by those that are already 
being exploited by it. 

Thank You for your consideration, 

Yael Bromberg
