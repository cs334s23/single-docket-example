To whom it may concern: 
I would like to express my great concern regarding the proposed 
increases in service fees for immigrants.  If compliance with 
immigration laws is desired, why make that even more difficult? 
These outrageous proposed fees will only increase the incidence 
of undocumented immigrants.  Please do not take this ridiculous 
action.
