A fee increase for the naturalization process is only going to contribute to the already 
existing issue of the abundant number of illegal immigrants that are in this country.  If the 
process to become legal continues to become more difficult it is evident that this problem 
will only continue to grow instead of being resolved.  If there are people already here 
legally why not keep the same minimum standards instead of increasing our existing 
problems. 

Sincerely,
