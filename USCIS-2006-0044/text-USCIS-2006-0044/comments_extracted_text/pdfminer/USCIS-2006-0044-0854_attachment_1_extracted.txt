Re:  DHS No. USCIS-2006-0044 

Our orchestra, the Orchestra of Southern Utah, had the privilege of  
having two exceptional young Chinese musicians as guest soloists two  
years ago.  It was an inspiring performance for our isolated community 
and we felt that it was very beneficial.  It was, however, expensive  
and difficult to get the visas. 

We would recommend that the visa cost not rise any further or we will  
not be able to have any foreign musicians.  In this case the  
communication with these young people and their school is resulting in 
an opportunity for our orchestra to perform in China.  We plan to  
perform the Spanish Trail Suite complete with Paiute dancers and  
drummers on the program.  This will also serve as an introduction to  
the west for Chinese who are interested in traveling to Utah and our  
beautiful national parks.  We feel that promoting tourism is a  
valuable service of the arts. 

This type of exchange performance is exciting for our musicians and  
our community.  Please keep the visa fee at the current level.  It is  
already expensive and an increase will discourage this type of musical 
enrichment. 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.
