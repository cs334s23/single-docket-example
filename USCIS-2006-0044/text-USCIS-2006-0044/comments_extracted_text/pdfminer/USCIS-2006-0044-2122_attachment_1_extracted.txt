Dear Director, 

I object to the proposed increase of the filing fees for non-immigrant worker petitions.  The proposed 
increase in the Form I-129 and Form I-824 filing fees will be financially burdensome.  Before U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) contemplates any price increase, regular processing 
procedures must be improved. 

We are a small artist management, representing approximately fifteen different performing arts touring 
companies.  We represent artists from three continents:  North America, Europe & Australia.  We 
typically file three to four applications for visas on an annual basis for our international clientele to tour 
to the United States.  These cultural exchanges are vital to the United Stateâ€™s ongoing diplomacy efforts.  
Delays and unpredictably in the current visa process have made it increasingly difficult for us to bring 
these artists in the country.   

The USCIS shld not consider any fee increases without first improving regular processing procedures.  I 
am especially concerned about how long it takes to be notified right now;   waiting for a response is 
totally unpredictable.  We honestly never know which way an application is going to go! 

Thank you for your time and attention to these comments. 

Sincerely, Laura Colby
