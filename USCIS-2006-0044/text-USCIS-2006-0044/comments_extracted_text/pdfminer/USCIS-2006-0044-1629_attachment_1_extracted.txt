Subject: Immigration: Benefit application fee schedule adjustment DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-
0044 

                                        11 Big Oak Circle 
                                        Stamford, CT 06903 

                                        March 20, 2007 

I have lived in Stamford, CT for most of my life. My concerns about S 795, which would help keep 
fees for those who immigrate at a reasonable level, are for a number of reasons. Keeping families 
together, recognizing the very low incomes many immigrants must deal with, I support the 
Citizenship Promotion Act 2007. Proposed higher fees would be rejected under this bill. People 
arriving here would be given reasonable time for background and security checks to be 
completed.  

I will be in touch with members of Congress from Connecticut, asking that they support 
the efforts of Senator Obama, Representative Gutierrez, and  
a growing list of cosponsors of the Citizenship Promotion Act 2007 to reject proposed fee 
increases for immigration status applications and to  
promote equity and patriotism within the U.S. immigration system.  

A person earning minimum wage would have to save an entire month's pay to file a 
$1,370 application to adjust from temporary to permanent residence (up 661 percent from 
$180). That is an increase that is excessive, in my opinion.  

Thank you for your attention.   
                                              Sincerely, 

                                              Leslie Weinberg
