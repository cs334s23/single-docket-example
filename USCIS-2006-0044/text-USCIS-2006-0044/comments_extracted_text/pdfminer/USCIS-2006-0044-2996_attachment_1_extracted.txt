RE:  DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 
Proposed rule--  Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Application and Petitio~ 
Fee Schedule 

Fresno Interdenominational Refugee Ministries(FIRM, Inc.) is deeply concerned about the 
proposed USCIS fee increase referenced above. 

FIRM serves more than 6,500 refugees annually, many from Southeast Asia and the former Soviet 
Union, through a variety of programs including Employment, Health, Housing, Elder and Preschool 
services.  One of our primary areas of service for the last 10 years has also been ESL and 
Citizenship training and assistance with completing Adjustment of Status and Citizenship 
applications.  We are pleased to have assisted hundreds of refugees to overcome language and 
other barriers to become American citizens.

We are troubled bv the sheer size and scope of the fee increase.  USCIS plans to increase citizenshil 
fees from $400 ($530 application fee plus$70 biometric fee) to $675 ($595 application fee plus $8t 
biometric fee), an increase of 69 percent.  It would also raise fees for 37 other immigration and 
naturalization petitions and applications at an average increase of 66%.  Furthermore, it appears thal 
the increase will take place at once rather than being spread out over a period of time. 

- 

,, 

Rapid fee hikes of such magnitude will have a disproportionate and detrimental impact on the Asiar 
American community, many of whom are refugees fleeing persecution, and on the broader refugee 
community.  As the following figures reflect, Asian Americans constitute a significant portion of 
USCIS's  customer base: 

39% of people who naturalized in 2005 were born in Asia. 
Five of the top ten countries of birth for new U.S. citizens are Asian (Philippines, India, 
Vietnam, People's Republic of China, and Korea). 
36% of people who became lawful permanent residents (LPRs) in 2005 were born in Asia. 
Five of the top ten countries of birth for new LPRs are Asian (India, China, Philippines, 
Vietnam, and Korea). 
Significant number of asylees and refugees came from Asian countries such as Laos (16% 
of refugees admitted in 2005) and China (21% of asylum granted in 2005). 

"Z'm laying a FZRMfoundation ... no one who trusts in it will ever be disappointed. " Isaiah 28: 16 

FIRM'S primary populations of service include Hmong and Lao individuals, both from Laos, all of 
whom had to flee their homeland because of support of U.S. policies during the Vietnam war era. 
Their deep commitment to this country and its ideals cost them everything, yet their desire to be 
American citizens and fully contribute to this country is strong. 

The massive and abrupt fee increase proposed by USCIS will delay or prevent Asian Americans from 
becoming U.S. citizens, reuniting with their families, contributing their knowledge and skills to our 
economy, and settling into our society after having escaped persecution. 

A family of four LPRs who want to apply for U.S. citizenship at the same time will now have to 
have $2,700 at their disposal in order to achieve their American dream together. 

A family of four who have been granted asylum in the U.S. and applying for permanent residence 
will now have to have $3,620 in hand in order to apply for permanent residence. 

Furthermore, asylees applying for permanent residence will not be able to apply for fee waivers no 
matter how dire their financial situation may be, because USCIS intends to categorically eliminate 
fee waivers for 1-485 applications for adjustment as a part of the fee increase. 

The proposal justifies the elimination of the fee waivers for 1-485s on the ground that "[alpplicants 
for permanent residence must demonstrate that they can support themselves and will not become a 
public charge."  But such rationale does not and should not apply to asylees, who are exempt from 
the public charge ground of inadmissibility.  8 C.F.R. ยง209.2(a)(l)(v). 

The proposal would also prohibit U.S. citizens and LPRs from requesting fee waivers on 1-130 
relative petitions on the ground that the petitioners must file affidavits of support to show that they 
can support the beneficiaries if they are not able to do so themselves.  But such a rationale ignores 
the factthat given the current backlogs in the family immigration system, it may be years, sometimes 
even decades, before the petitioners will have to file affidavits of support for the beneficiaries. For 
example, a U.S. citizen mother who is petitioning for her adult son or daughter from the country of 
Philippines will have to wait approximately 14 years from the time that she files the 1-130 petition to 
when the visa for her child becomes available and needs the affidavit of support. 

The elimination of fee waivers for 1-130 family petitions would place many U.S. citizens q d  LPRs 
in a Catch-22:  They must file the 1-130 petitions in order to establish their families' place in line, yet 
be delayed or prevented altogether from doing so because of financial difficulties that will no longer 
exist by the time that the visas for their families finally become available and they have to file the 
necessary affidavits of support. 

The fee hike and the blanket ban on fee waivers on certain applications and petitions would be particularly 
burdensome to the roughly 12% of the Asian American community who live below the poverty level, 
including many refugees.  The proposed fee increases will put citizenship and adjustment of status simplv out 
of reach. 

Given the speed, scope and scale of the proposed fee increase, we believe that USCIS customers must 
receive faster, greater, and more concrete improvements in processing times and customer service.  The fee 
increase proposal itself does not appear to set forth any concrete targets for improvement in these areas.  The 
USCIS press release announcing the fee increase proposal states that the fee hike, "if implemented in full by 
this summer,"  will result in "a  20 percent reduction in average application processing times by the end of 
fiscal year 2009."  A hike in prices by an average of 66 percent now in return for a 20 percent reduction m 

processing times two to three years down the road is not "they type of exceptional immigration seMce that 
our nation expects or deserves." 

Finally, we believe that certain improvements which the USCIS wants to finance through the fee increase 
would be better addressed through the normal budget and appropriation process.  For example, while we 
support USCIS's efforts to improve its fiaud detection capacity and to modernize its business and 
technological infrastructure, we do not believe that immigrants and their families should bear the sole burden 
for these efforts.  These improvements will benefit the immigration system and the national interest as a 
whole, and the budgetary process would be the best mechanism for Congress, USCIS, its customers, and 
other interested parties to determine how such functions would be optimally funded. 

In conclusion, we urge USCIS to reconsider the proposed fee increase.  We hope that the agency will work 
with immigrant communities and with Congress to develop a functioning, effective immigration system that 
will benefit our country.
