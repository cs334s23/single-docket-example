DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear USCIS, 

I am deeply concerned with the proposed increase in the application fee for U.S. 
citizenship and other immigration benefits. As a social worker and as a citizen of New 
York City, I have many friends, neighbors and clients that would be negatively affected 
by this increase. 

I believe that USCIS should find a solution that promotes, rather than discourages, 
immigrant integration.  I believe the fee increase would discourage low-income legal 
immigrants from pursuing permanent resident status and citizenship.  This is clearly a 
strike against integration efforts.  Encouraging integration is in national interest because 
it strengthens national security.  Inviting and involving immigrants in our societyâ€™s public 
institutions is good for our nation.  

The United States is a nation that is strengthened by the contributions of newcomers of 
all backgrounds.  Raising the obstacles to integration goes against this legacy. 

Finally, I believe the cost of processing immigration and naturalization benefit 
applications and petitions should NOT be on the backs of prospective immigrants. I 
believe Congress should appropriate money for technology and infrastructure 
improvements at USCIS. 

Faithfully submitted, 

__Kristin D. Goodwin___
