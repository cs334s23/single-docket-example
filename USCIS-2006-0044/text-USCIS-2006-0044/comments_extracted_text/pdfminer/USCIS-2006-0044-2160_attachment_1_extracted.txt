Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

USCIS-2006-0044 

I beseech you not to approve an increase for adoption funds. It is already difficult enough to 
locate and raise money for adoption, it should not cost more. I feel that if prices are increased it 
will only discourage parents from adopting and leave more children without parents.
