Subject: proposed adjustment/increase in I-485 petition fee 

The USCIS intends to increase most of the immigration petition fees.  
One big proposal is to pay I-485 petition as a whole package (including 
I-765 and I-131).  Isn't this a ridiculous idea.  We have the right to 
file I-485 only; then why are we responsible to pay for the other two 
(I-765 and I-131)???
