The new fee increases, especially those that apply to non-employment related documents, 
will result in increased expense to USCIS and the Government in general.  Aliens have 
difficulty raising the funds to apply for benefits and often leave out children or spouses.  
This result in more individuals who have no legal status and later end up in expensive 
removal proceedings merely because they are no longer eligible for a benefit. 

Leave fees where they are.  Congress needs to create a permanent solution to the 
problem.
