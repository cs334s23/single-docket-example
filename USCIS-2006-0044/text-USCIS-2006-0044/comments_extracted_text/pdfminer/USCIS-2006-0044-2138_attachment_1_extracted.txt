Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To whom it may concern: 

I am writing today to register a comment about the prosposed fee increase for many 
USCIS petitions and applications. I am particularly concerned about the enormous fee 
increase -on top of an already high fee - for the I600 & I600A - Orphan Petition and 
Advanced Orphan Petition. The fee for the I600 & I600A are already amongst the highest 
charged by USCIS. Additionally - the nature of international adoption is such that many, 
if not most, families are required to submit renewal applications at least once during the 
whole process of waiting for a child to come home. This is a heavy burden on many 
families financially. Adopting internationally is already quite expensive and while no one 
disputes the US government's right to impose some reasonable fee for determining a 
family's suitability to adopt there should be some consideration that these families are 
already spending a significant amount of money and then to have to spend it again.. well 
that does not seem reasonable.  We filed our most recent I600 this year spending $685.00 
for two adults to be fingerprinted and we may actually have to do this up to two more 
times as the wait times for adoptions from China are upwards of 3 years at the moment. 
That just seems unreasonable. 

I could imagine if a I600/I600A and the resulting 171H 793C lasted until the adoption 
was complete - that is not having to refingerprint in 15 months and refile the I600 in 18 
months an increase as the one you suggest would be acceptable - but as it is it is double 
dipping into the same pot and that seems distinctly unfair. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment and if you would like further information or 
clarification - please do not hesitate to contact me.
