The new fees described in uscis 2006-0044 are an outrage!  The fees that are currently 
charged are extremely difficult for an average family to afford.  The enormous increase 
will only serve to hurt the hard working middle and lower classes.  The extra fees will 
also hurt those worldwide who are the most vulnerable - orphans.  Already the huge 
expenses involved in adoption are making it nearly impossible for loving families to take 
in helpless, unloved children.  An increase would only make this more difficult.  These 
fees have nothing to do with our security.  They will only serve to hurt those already in 
difficult circumstances.
