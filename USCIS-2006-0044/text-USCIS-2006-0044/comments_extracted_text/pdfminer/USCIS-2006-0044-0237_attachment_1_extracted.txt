Dear Citizens~ 
     As a resident of ElPaso TX for almost 30 years, all I'll politely 
say, it's about damn time! Although I have many friends from 
Juarez, the place is a thirld world country, it is dangerous to 
even go to the Marcado anymore.  
     For many years, I've thought Passports should be the ID of 
each citizen. If they can't "afford" the fee, then just drive around 
in your pretencious SUV and eat gasoline and muck around with 
frivolous lawsuits. 
     Our family's appreciation of these proposals  are supported 
100 per cent and you go, guys! 
                            thankfully and sincerely, 
                                 MaryLynn Neill 
                                     710 Cincinnati Ave
