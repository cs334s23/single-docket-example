Subject: Fee increase 

Dear sir/madam: 

I am writing to express disagreement about the increase of fees to adjust status. In my  opinion 
this increase will be one more barrier to citizenship 

for many immigrants and it will also impact those seeking to obtain legal residency. The legal 
maze one must travel to reach the American Dream 

is hard and expensive enough without increasing the fees for all the forms. I hope you listen to 
the many voices that speak in  

opposition of this measures. 

Respectfully,
