I am writing in order to voice my opposition to increasing the fees to start 
the naturalization process for immigrants.  As the daughter of Irish 
immigrants I know how involved the process was to become a legal resident 
and later, a citizen.  I am firmly against raising these fees for people who 
are trying to go through the process legally and who are here in order to 
contribute to our economy and make a better life for their families. 
Sincerely, 
Mary Geraghty
