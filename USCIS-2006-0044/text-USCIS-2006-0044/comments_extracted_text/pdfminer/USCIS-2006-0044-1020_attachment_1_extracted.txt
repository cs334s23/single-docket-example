I find the proposed increases in Green Card and other citizenship fees 
to be reprehensible.  I want to voice my strong disagreement with these 
proposed hikes.  
Immigrant families already struggle trying to make ends meet in this 
country, which should welcome the tired, the poor, the homeless 
yearning to breathe free.  Breathe free?  This proposal will suffocate 
them.  - Margaret Pajakowski, Chicago, IL
