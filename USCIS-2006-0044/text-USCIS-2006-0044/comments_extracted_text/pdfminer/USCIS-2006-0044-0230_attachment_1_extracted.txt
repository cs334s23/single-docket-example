The proposed fee hike will prove to be de facto a breach of civil rights as it makes it virtually 
impossible for certain religious groups with large families (Bible based procreation) to raise the 
outrageous number of dollars to pay the 485 fees alone. 

It is worth remembering that NOT ONE fee hike has improved the service of the Service. The 
government needs to positively augment the current staff levels by raising the numbers and 
actually providing adequate training and facilities rather than cutting staff and raising fees. 

If the Service worked in the private sector it would have been driven out of business decades 
ago.
