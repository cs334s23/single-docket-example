Subject: Fee Increase 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I work for a non-profit agency and work with low-income to moderate-income clients. Many of my 
clients currently have incredible difficulty paying the current fee of $400 for Naturalization. A small 
number are eligible and approved for the Fee Waiver but many are not due to being slightly over-
income or for having a difficult to explain household composition because they rent a room from a 
friend or family member. 

An increase of $265 just for the N-400 form itself ($330 to $595), not including the biometrics fee, 
will make it impossible for the majority of my clients to fulfill their long time dream of becoming a 
U.S. Citizen. I strongly urge you to review and reconsider such a high increase. 

In these already difficult economic times, many of our clients can barely make ends meet. 
Currently, many cut back on a couple of necessities in order to pay the current Naturalization fee. 
This dramatic increase will discourage and make it impossible for many individuals to become 
U.S. Citizens. 

Therefore, I again ask that this increase be reconsidered and adjusted to a more reasonable fee. 
I 

I thank you in advance for your consideration. 

Sincerely,
