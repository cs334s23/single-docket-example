Subject: increased Green Card fees 

Dear Director, 

I have just seen the proposed increase in Green Card fees (from $325 to $905) 
and Citizenship fees (from $330 to $595) and I am appalled.  

When we are a nation that willingly takes in legal refugees and others from 
difficult circumstances, it seems absurd to tax them an exorbitant rate to 
become eligible for citizenship.  Many of these people come to the U.S. with 
minimal, if any, language skills, little to no money, and no matter what their 
previous profession, they are starting at the bottom for new employment.  Many 
professionals are forced to become janitors because we don't recognize their 
educational level. 

These people could spend a lifetime trying to acquire enough savings in order 
to "buy" their gift of green card/citizenship.  We are essentially giving them no 
more than "guest worker" status, which is what this proposed law will in fact 
make them,  

I strongly protest this high-handed and bureaucratic effort to limit citizenship to 
those oppressed groups who are legally entering this country.
