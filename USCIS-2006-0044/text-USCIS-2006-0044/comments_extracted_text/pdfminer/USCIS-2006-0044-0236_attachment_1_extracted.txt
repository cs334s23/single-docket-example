Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

Gentlemen: 

I wish to express my opposition to the extreme increase in fees for Forms I-
90, I-129F, I-485 and N-400. 
We want to have aliens who are in the USA become citizens if they desire to 
be here.  To raise the fees involved makes it all the more likely that they will 
fail to do so simply because they cannot afford it.  Please reconsider this 
proposal. 
Thank you, 
  Francis Urban
