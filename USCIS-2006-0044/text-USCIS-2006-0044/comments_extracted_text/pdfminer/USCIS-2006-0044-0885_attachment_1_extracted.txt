To Whom it May Concern, 

As a concerned citizen of the United States I would like to convey my horror at the recent 
proposed rate increase for application for permanent residency and citizenship.  I believe 
these increases will further burden our immigrant and refugee population and exasperate 
the problem of undocumented citizens. It would be very difficult for this population to 
come up with this sum of money and it is additionally hard to understand why a sudden 
increase of around 66% is necessary.  

Thank you, 

Colette Henderson
