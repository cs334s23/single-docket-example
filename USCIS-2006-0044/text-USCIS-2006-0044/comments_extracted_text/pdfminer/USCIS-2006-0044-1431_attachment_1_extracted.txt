Subject: Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

My Name is Rosa Chacon, I live In Harrisburg, Pa. I work at a Free Clinic, and talk to 
so many immigrant who work hard. They came legally to the US and can get enough 
money to pay for the citizenship. One particular man, a Cuban refugee came here in 
the 80's, severely asthmatic, can't work, and can't afford to get the money to get his 
citizenship, and can't get SSI because he doesn't have his citizenship. Increasing the 
price to pay to become a citizenship will only encourage more illegal coming in, since 
they will never be able to afford the amount.
