Dear Director,  

Please don't raise the Immigration Benefit Application/Petition and Biometric fees. 
Adoption is expensive enough already. We adopted a little girl from China four years ago 
and now have saved to adopt a second child. The adoption process is well worth it 
for the wonderful children who get placed but every dollar you raise the fees causes more 
parents to struggle with whether they can financially afford to adopt. Please don't force 
families out of the adoption process by raising fees.  

Sincerely,  
Kim Beckett 
San Antonio, Texas
