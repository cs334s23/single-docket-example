To Whom it May Concern, 

I am a refugee resettlement case worker with Church World Service Refugee and Immigration Program in 
Lancaster, PA.  I have worked in this job for 3 Â½ years, and prior to that, I worked in a volunteer capacity 
with refugees and asylees since 1993.  

I would like to advocate for the inclusion of asylees along with refugees in the exemption for paying for 
Adjustment of Status applications.  Other than the way they enter the US, there are no differences between 
refugees and asylees.  Many asylees, who do not have agency assistance, as refugees have)  have barely 
established themselves by one year after arrival, when they are eligible to apply for their Permanent 
Status.   An asylee family of 6, with three children over 14, would be expected to pay, under the new fees, 
over $5000.  If both parents are working full time at $10 an hour (an excellent wage in Lancaster, and 
rarely acheived during the first year) they would have to work for over 6 weeks to make enough to pay the 
fees (before taxes, not including fees for the medical exam).  

If the goal of granting asylum is to provide protection for those seeking refuge from tyranny and 
oppression, and incorporate them into American society in a timely manner, elimination of this expense, (or 
alternatively, reducing it or putting a cap on the fee for a nuclear family all filing at the same time) would 
go a long way to furthering this goal. 

Thank you for considering this suggestion.
