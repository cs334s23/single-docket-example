RE:  DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 
Proposed de- Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Application and 
Petition Fee Schedule 

I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed increases in immigration and naturalization fees 
that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published in the Federal ReRister on 
February 1,2007. 

Current fees already are a financial problem for many immigrants and refugees who want to 

seek citizenship and become full participants in U.S.  society.  The increases in the fees being 
proposed by United States Citizenship and Immigration Senice (USCIS) would make the 
hancial batriers even more difficult to cross over, putting the goals of gaining permanent resident 
status, reuniting with family members, and ultimately becoming a US citizen even further out of 
reach. 

Under the proposed d e ,  fees would rise significantly. The I-129F alien fianci petition to 
immigrate would cost $455, up from $170.  Filing an 1-130 immigrant relative petition would cost 
$355,-up  fiom $190.  Those fee increases wouldkeep relatives apart longer, creating another 
hurdle for family reunification.  Almost doubling the costs of an L765 application for employment 
authorization to $340 (up fiom $180) would create higher costs for immigrant and non-immigrant 
visa holders who seek to work in America legally.  The proposed rule would even charge $290 
just to replace a green card or $380 to replace a naturalization or citizenship certificate. 

What i s  of most concern are the proposed fee hikes in the cost to apply for naturalization and 

to file an 1-485  application for a green card.  In the past eight years, these costs have increased 
dramatically.  In 1998, the cost to apply for citizenship was $95.  When the Bush Administration 
took office in 2002, the cost went h m  $250 to $310.  Currently, the total fee is $400.  The 
USCIS's proposed rule calls for the naturalization fee to climb h m  $400 per person to $675 per 
person, a 70% increase.

The most dramatic increase would occur in the proposed cost of filing for adjushent of status 

which would increase from $325 to $905.  For many immigrants, getting a green card is the fist 
step in becoming a U.S. citizen.  A fee of $905, in combination with the $80 cast of biornetrics, 
would put adjusment of status out of reach for thousands of immigrants, shutting the door before 
they can even begin the process of becoming a citizen. 

In addition to excessive fees, I am also concerned that immigrants would have to use an 
electronic ~g  system, regardless of whether they have access to and an understanding of the 
Internet.  Under the proposed rule, anyone filing an immigration application must submit an extra 
19-page form to set up an "immigration account" and to pay an additional $100 fee.  While we 
need to collect sdficient idormation, it is also unclear how this additional 19-page form is 
necessary to achieve ~ I I  
goal.  The excessive costs and burdens those changes could add would 
create hancial and paperwork barriers that would keep immigrants from American citizenship 
and the rights and benefits that come with it. 

While current law provides a waiver for himmigrants and their families who cannot afford the 
fees, the USCIS's  proposed rule also include adjustments to the fee waiver policy that will prevent 
many from being able to do so,  For example, immigrants looking to adjust their status would no 
longer qualify for the fee waiver.  Even VAWA self-petitioners would be m b l e  to get the fee for 
their adjustment of status waived.  USCIS should Eully explain why fee waivers should not be 
available for all applications, including 1-821 applications for ITS and 1-824s. 

Clearly, there is a need to improve service, to eliminate processing backlogs and to provide 
infkasctucture improvements.  However, there is no clear justification for how those improvements 
justify the need for such significant increases in fees or whether those fee increases would actually 
result in improvements.  Past fee hikes have come with assurances that the additional revenue 
would help improve service yet problems continue.  October 2006's Government Accountability 
Office report, "Immigration Benefits: Additional Efforts Needed to Help Ensure Alien Files Are 
Located when Needed," revealed that the agency had lost track of 110,000 files needed to process 
citizenship cases highlighting the need for improved file bacbng and other Mastructure.  And 
immigrants and their families still have difficulty getting accurate information about their cases. 
More must be done before the USCIS raises fees or incorporates changes that will only create 
overwhelming challenges for those applying for citizenship or green cards.

A ~ a i r ~  

I urge the USCB to reconsider this ~rovosed rule.  The United States should not 

- 
impose excessive fees and filing requirements that prevent many immigrants from pursuing their 
dream of becoming American citizens.  Thank you for your consideration.
