To Whom It May Concern:  

I want to comment on recent fee increase rule proposal:  

This fee increase is significant but there is no solid ground to guarantee the better service.  

If the fee increase can certainly speed up the application processing and service level, people 
who can afford this might be more willing to pay. However, there is no any promise I can see in 
the rule that gives the specification on how the processing time will be decreased and service will 
be better. Especially when the delay of processing is due to the background check with outside 
agency, how would the fee increase help it?  

Even with the 6 month promise for adjustment of status application now, we still see lots of 
applications are processed beyond 6 month, some are up to years. No matter what percentage of 
those applications are, it's not fair for those who are left behind but still pay the same fee.   

Unless there is a convincing reason or evidence to directly benefit ALL customers significantly (in 
most cases, people care most about the processing time), this significant fee increase will only 
add another painful load to the customers' shoulder. 

Thanks for your consideration.
