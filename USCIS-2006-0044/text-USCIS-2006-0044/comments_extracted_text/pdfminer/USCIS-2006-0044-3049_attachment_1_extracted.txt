RE:  DHS Docket NO. USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear Director: 

I am writing to comment on the proposed rule published in the Federal Register on February 1,2007 by 
the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to increase fees for several applications. 

I am writing on behalf of Washington University in St. Louis, a private research university.  As the 
Director of the Office for International Students and Scholars, the office which is responsible for the 
students and scholars from other countries, 1 oversee the filing of various immigration applications on 
behalf of Washing18.0n Unjversity,  The University has approximately 2,500 students, postdoctoral 
scholars, researchms, professors and other employees on nonimrnigrant statuses, including F-l Student, J- 
1 Exchange Visitor, and H-1B Specialty Workers.  In addition, Washington University sponsors betwecn 
30 and 50 employees for employment-based permanent residence every year.  I have over 20 years of 
experience in  filing university-sponsored applications with federal immigration agencies. 

There are substantial increases in fees for the following applications, which are of  concern to Washington 
University: 

1-765, is praposed to increase from $180 to $340; 
1-140 is prc~posed to increase from $195 to $280; 
1-485 is prc~posed to increase from $325 to $905; and 
1-539 is prcrposed to increase from $200 to $300 

The USCIS indica1.e~ that these fees are to be increased to cover the all costs for the services of the 
USCIS.  I believe i'hat the only actual costs of processing the applications or petitions should be covered 
through the user fees.  There are other costs for the maintenance of the immigration system that should not 
fall on the users.  My concern is that the considcrably higher costs of thc immigration system will drive 
our international students, faculty, and researchers to other countries.  There is a strong national. benefit to 
the U.S. of  havinginternational students and scholars -- benefits to our foreign policy, the education of 
U.S. citizen studen8ts, and to our economy.  In the current environment of globalization, the U.S. cannot 
afford to fall behind in the competition for the best and brightest international students and scholars.  Thc 
importance of the international. students and scholars to the U.S. has frequently been recognized by the 
President, the Secretary of  State and the Secretary of Homeland Security.

The proposed rule would exempt certain applications from fees.  I do not question the need to provide 
these benefits without fees to those users.  However, this is an example where other users will subsidize 
the fees for those aiho are fee-exempt.  The exemptions from these fees are a matter of public policy, so 
the cost of the proc'zssing of those applications should be covered through appropriated funds, rather than 
from other users of the immigration system. 

Besides the general issue of funding public policy through appropiated monies, rather than user fees, I 
have some specific comments related to the proposed fee increases for certain application types, 
specifically the 1-765 and the 1-485. 

The 1-765 application is filed by many F-1 students to obtain work authorization for optional practical 
training (OPT),  Ti-e  authority to grant OPT used to be carried out by Designated School Officials 
(DSOs), but this is now carried out by the USCIS.  Under the Stodcnt and Exchange Visitor Information 
System (SEVIS), this authorization could be delegated back to the DSOs, to decrease the costs in 
adjudicating the work permit applications.  The OPT applications are fairly routine and are usually 
approved by the U!<CIS, so there seems to be no benefit to overloading the immigration service centers 
with this type of applications. 

The substantial inaease in the 1-485 adjustment of  status to permanent residence application has been 
justified on the basis that the work permit and advance parole permission are automatically included in  the 
application. In my experience, I have seen that many, if not most, of our applicants do not use the benefits 
of the work permit or the advance parole, as they have valid work permission and a valid visa under the 
H-1B status for the  entire time they are going through the permanent residence process.  Thus, with these 
new fees, our applicants for permanent residence will be paying for benefits that they never intend to use. 
I suggest that the work permit and advance parole application remain separate from the 1-485 application, 
so that those who need the benefits to work or travel outside the U.S. pay for such benefits, without 
penalizing those who will not use these benefits. 

In summary, I reccgnize the need to make adjustments to the fees to provide for additional funds to 
process the immigration applications.  However, I ask that the fees be set up to cover the actual cost of 
processing applications, rather than the entire cost of the immigration system.  I believe that Congress 
should provide funding to support the public policy priorities in the immigration system. 

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. 

Sincerely, 

Kathy  e'  er-Lang
