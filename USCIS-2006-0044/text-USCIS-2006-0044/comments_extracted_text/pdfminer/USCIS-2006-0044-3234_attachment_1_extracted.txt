Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044

Re: DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 
Proposed rule— Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit 
Application and Petition Fee Schedule 
Dear Mr. Sloan: 
I am deeply concerned about the impact that the proposed fee increases by 
the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will have on the 
refugees and asylees we serve. The recently proposed increases will create a 
significant obstacle for many vulnerable migrants, including refugees and 
asylees seeking to integrate into the United States by becoming permanent 
residents or naturalizing as U.S. Citizens. 

In Section IX: Proposed Fee Adjustments, USCIS is proposing a fee of $905 
for an I-485 adjustment of status application, representing an increase of 
$580 from the current fee of $325. This proposed fee will prevent many 
asylees from being able to apply for legal permanent residence, which will 
delay their eligibility to naturalize as U.S. Citizens. Currently, many 
asylees have considerable trouble paying the current $325 fee and will 
either wait to adjust, sometimes years after they are eligible, or request a 
fee waiver. Under this USCIS proposal, however, not only is the application 
fee undergoing a 178% increase, USCIS is proposing to categorically 
eliminate the availability of fee waivers for all I-485 adjustment of status 
applications, except for refugees adjusting status under INA §209(a) who 
will continue to be automatically exempt from the paying the I-485 
application fee. 

In Section XI: fee waivers of the proposed rule, USCIS argues that because 
the likelihood of becoming a public charge is a ground of inadmissibility 
under INA §212(a)(4), allowing for a fee waiver for an adjustment 
application is inconsistent with the requirements of the benefit sought. 
When the applicant for permanent residence is an asylee this rationale is 
inconsistent with USCIS’s mandate in INA §286(m) to offset the fee burden of 
“similar services provided without charge to asylum applicants or other 
immigrants.”  Similar to refugees, asylees are eligible for public 
assistance by virtue of their status and, according to 8 C.F.R. 
§209.2(a)(1)(v), the public charge ground of inadmissibility does not apply 
to asylees adjusting status. For an asylee, seeking a need-based waiver for 
an I-485 application is entirely consistent with the historical treatment of 
the population. The current policy is mindful of the desperate circumstances 
that force asylum seekers to flee their homes and the dire financial 
situation an asylee may face during the early stages of his/her new life in 

 
 
 
 
 
the United States. The I-485 fee must also take this reality into 
consideration and, at least, provide waivers for those who most need the 
assistance. 

I thank USCIS for continuing to exempt refugees adjusting their status under 
INA §209(a) from paying the I-485 adjustment of status application fee.  
However, this does not alleviate the extraordinary burden that the proposed 
adjustment fees will impose upon asylees. Therefore, I recommend that USCIS 
reevaluate the fee structure, especially the extraordinary increase, and 
institute a fee policy which is consistent, reasonable and affordable for 
asylees applying for adjustment of status.  I especially encourage USCIS to 
maintain an accessible and clear fee waiver policy, particularly for those 
populations, such as asylees or trafficking victims, who receive public 
benefits by virtue of their status and/or are otherwise exempt from the 
public charge ground of inadmissibility. For example, since asylees are in 
similar compelling circumstances as refugees, they should receive the same 
automatic exemption from paying adjustment fees as refugees. 

Under the proposed fee, in Section IX: Proposed Fee Adjustments, the cost 
for the N-400 naturalization application would increase from $330 to $595, 
which represents an increase of 80 percent. For a family of four to 
naturalize, they would have to have $2,380 in hand (an extra $1,060 over the 
current fee), solely for the application fee. Such an expense would create 
an unreasonably difficult economic hardship for individuals who are eligible 
for naturalization and want to strengthen our nation’s life by participating 
more fully in it as citizens. 

For a refugee or asylee who has fled their home country and sought freedom 
and protection in the United States, the ability to naturalize as a U.S. 
citizen is one of the most important steps that individual can make toward 
becoming full participants in American society.  Naturalization is a key 
component of the integration process and the Bush administration has 
recognized this, saying that helping immigrants become U.S. citizens is a 
priority. Furthermore, Article 34 of the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the 
Status of Refugees, as adopted by the 1967 UN Protocol Relating to Status of 
Refugees, to which the United States is a party, mandates that states make 
every possible effort to facilitate the naturalization of refugees and 
reduce as far as possible the costs of such proceedings. Given that 
citizenship is optimal for both an individual applicant and the country as a 
whole, Lutheran Family Services in the Carolinas, Refugee Resettlement, is 
particularly troubled by the size and scope of the proposed fee increase for 
naturalization. 

I recommend USCIS reconsider this extraordinarily large increase and adopt a 
fee policy that is more realistic with what individuals and families, who 
receive benefits by virtue of their status as refugees or asylees, may be 
able to afford when seeking to naturalize. This should also include an 
affordable flat fee or a fee cap for a family to naturalize. 

In conclusion, I urge USCIS to reconsider the proposed fee increase’s impact 
on refugees and asylees.  I ask that USCIS work with members of Congress to 
help resolve the disparity in adjudication costs versus revenues collected. 
USCIS must create an alternative and permanent funding stream that will 
support its operations. Seeking appropriations from Congress that supplement 
what USCIS collects in fees is the only realistic way for USCIS to operate 
effectively without imposing undue hardship upon individuals seeking to 

 
 
 
 
 
access immigration benefits. It also helps to assure that vulnerable 
individuals are not marginalized but are integrated into U.S. communities, 
achieving a good outcome for the individuals and a common good for the 
greater community. 

Thank you for hearing our concerns. 
Sincerely, 

Katherine Doom
