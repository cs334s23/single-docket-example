International Adoption costs continue to rise as the costs of travel 
and increase in documents, postage and International doctor exam fees 
continue have gone up. With the current accrediting process coming into 
place, more fees will be incurred in the next few years which will 
ultimately affect the cost increases to prospective families. 

We work so hard and give so much to help children find a permanent and 
loving home, please reconsider how this price increase will affect so 
many people who are already scraping for the money to complete an 
International Adoption. 

The media has been very negative on Guatemala recently and fails to 
mention all the above board agencies and successful placements. They 
seem to forget that teenage children with successful adoptions from 
Guatemala live in our neighborhoods and read the papers. We need to 
advocate for the adoptive families, instead of against them. 

Your consideration in eliminating this increase is greatly appreciated,
