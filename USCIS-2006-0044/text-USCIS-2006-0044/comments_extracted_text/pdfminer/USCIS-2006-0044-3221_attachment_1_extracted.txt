Subject: To Oppose the New Fee 

To USCIS: 

On behalf of many refugees and immigrants live in Fresno County, I see that 
your proposal on February 1, 2007 which to increase citizenship and green card fees by 
an average of 66% will impact the new refugees and immigrants as following: 

(cid:131)  Many new refugees and immigrants work lower wage jobs due to language 

barriers and skills and live at or below the poverty level.   Many simply cannot 
afford such high fees. Families will have to choose between the immediate needs 
of providing for their family or paying for application fees to achieve their dreams 
of becoming permanent residents and citizens. 

(cid:131)  The increased fees may further prolong the citizenship process for many whose 
incomes are dependent on their attainment of citizenship such as elders and 
disabled refugees who receive SSI benefits. The inability to obtain their 
citizenship after the allotted timeframe will result in the termination of their 
benefits â€“ a main source of income for many. 

Therefore, please do not increase the new fee. Thank you for your cooperation.   

Sincerely,
