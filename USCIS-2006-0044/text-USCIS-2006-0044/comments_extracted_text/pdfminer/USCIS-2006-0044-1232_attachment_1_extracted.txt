Subject: raising fees 

Hello, 

Our names our Rick and Lisa Boorman and we have been in the process of adopting a little girl in 
China. We started the process in January and we logged in our date April of 2006. We are still 
waiting and we are getting to the point that our I-600 and N-600 will be expiring and we will have 
to reply. Not only does this seem not fair to us because we have already filed and paid once now 
we are getting told the fees will be raised. This is so wrong. We are not a wealthy couple and all 
of our savings are going to this adoption by the time we are down we will have paid over 20,000 
for this opportunity to adopt. Please reconsider these fees and think about the children and 
families you will be affecting.  

Thank you for your time, 

Rick and Lisa Boorman
