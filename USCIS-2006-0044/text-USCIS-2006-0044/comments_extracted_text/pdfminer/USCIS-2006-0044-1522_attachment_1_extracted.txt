Subject: FEE INCREASE 

I disagree with the new fee increase that USCIS is planning to put into effect in the near 
future.  First,  there  is  always  an  increase  in  the  fee  alleging  that  they  will  speed  up  the 
process, however, that never happened, the only thing that they have done regarding the 
speeding  process  is  the  Infopass,  which  allow  us  have  an  appointment  an  not  to  wait 
hours outside the immigration office. Second, your allegation that ‘half’ of the applicant 
for  I485  apply  for  I-131,  and  for  that  reason  you  will  include  that  a  fee  in  the  new 
application; I disagree with your position because you will affect more that half of the I-
485 applicants that do not want to travel outside.
