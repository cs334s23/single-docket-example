I would like to let you know that I strongly opposed the fees being raised.  I am part of the 
Chinese adoption community (we have a daughter from China) and we feel that is adds to the 
already difficult burden and expense we all have to go through to make our dreams come true of 
having a precious child join our family.  This may put this dream out of reach of some families 
desperately wanting to build their family through adoption.
