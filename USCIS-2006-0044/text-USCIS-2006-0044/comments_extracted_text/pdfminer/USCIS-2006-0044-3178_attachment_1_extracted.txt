Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

As some one who might want to adopt a child from any other country I 
feel that the price that  we have to put out is all ready high to more 
money sound like it is getting harder and harder to adopt a child. 
Unless you happen to be a movie star or some one with money. You want 
people to some thing good then you keep raising the stakes. Right now it 
takes a year or so to get a child from a different county so the have to 
renew there paper work with you added a never fee, let the same paper 
work, be used until the child is adopted for at lease two years. That 
will save the parents that are adopting some cost. I think that the 
price hike is unreasonable to do when there is so money laid out now. 
Thank you for your time.
