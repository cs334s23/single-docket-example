Dear Director, Regulatory Management Division, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 
Department of Homeland Security, 

My name is Thomas Carey and I am the International Student Advisor/Immigration Specialist at 
the University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, MN. 

In 1998, our students paid $70 to file the form I-765 with USCIS. In 1999 they paid $100, the 
years 2000 and 2002 $120. Examples of the proposed fees include: OPT (I-765) current: $180, 
proposed new fee: $340. Change of status (I-539) current: $200, proposed new fee: 
$300. Replace lost I-94 (I-102) current: $160, proposed new fee: $320.

This is very upsetting because in the 2004/2005 academic year there were 8,491 international 
students in Minnesota. According to IIE.org they spent $172,057,746 in tuition, fees and living 
expenditures for themselves and their dependents. Our students must create solid portfolios, take 
English language tests, jump through many academic and financial hoops and leave their families 
in their home countries in order to contribute to the U.S. industry and economy. At UST they are 
full-tuition paying and must meet the Financial Certification amount of $36,214 and receive no 
need-based scholarships. We have international students at the bachelors, Masters, and 
Doctorate level.  

By raising fees, it looks like the U.S. is not a welcoming place for international students. Many 
students feel that they are getting 'nickeled and dimed". They bring so much money to our 
country as is that asking them to pay more for necessary processing forms seems short-sighted. 

I fear that in return the U.S. will see retaliation fee hikes for our off campus studies students like 
the one announced last week. "Fee Hike for International Students in Singapore. Singapore's 
Ministry of Education is planning to increase fees paid by international 
students." http://www.business-standard.com/common/story 
page.php?autono=273244&leftnm=6&subLeft=0&chkFlg And why shouldn't they? The country of 
Ireland just changed its policy so that a student registration with the police costs 100 euros. Just 
last year our spring 2006 study abroad participants paid nothing. It is hard enough to encourage 
U.S. students to forfeit their work study money, sub-lease their apartment, save money for today's 
exchange rate of $1 to .52 United Kingdom Pounds and apply for student visas. Although strong-
willed students will always find a way to a global experience, added fees like Singapore's will not 
help my recruiting efforts. 

Please do not dramatically increase your fees this year. 

Thank you.
