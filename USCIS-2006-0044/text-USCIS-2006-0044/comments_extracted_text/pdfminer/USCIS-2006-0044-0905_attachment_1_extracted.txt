Greetings. the sole idea of raising fees to all immigrants in a nation of immigrants is like 
committing suicide. already we see how many in the world prefer to go to study and work 
to other nations who are friendlier and offer more opportunities. 
Currently, we have 12 million immigrants waiting for a solution of their problems, and 
millions waiting for years for their legal solutions. immigrants work day and night to feed 
their families and pay bills, pay taxes, and abide by the rules. 
it is simple against any common sense and inhumane to raise fess 3 or 4 hundred percent 
just to satisfy the ego of the DHS. 
Since the creation of the DHS , everything went downhill for immigrants, everything 
takes forever to complete, raising fees went out of control and this time they want to suck 
us our last drop of blood to indulge your pockets. 
Does this country know the meaning of compassion and respect to human beings? 
YOU people need to go and bring new ones who care about the future of this nation: 
immigrants.
