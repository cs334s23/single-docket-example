RE: DHS Docket No. USCIS 2006-0044 

Dear Director of Regulatory Management: 

I write in strong opposition to the proposal by the United States Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (USCIS) to increase the fees for starting the naturalization process, 
Under the USCIS'  proposal, the fee for filing the F m  N-400 would increase from $330 
to $595, and the biometrics fee would increase from $70 to $80, resulting in a total 
increase from $400 to $675.  The proposed 69% fee hike is an unfair burden for 
hardworking newcomers who wish to become U.S. citizens and participate in e v q t h m g  
that this nation has to offer. 

Currently, many newcomer families have limited resources, and they work tirelessly to 
save up the money required to pay the current $400 naturalization application cost. 
According to data h m  the U.S. Census, about onethird (36%) of non-citizen households 
have annual incomes that are less than $25,000.  Family members often want to pursue 
U.S. citizenship by applying for naturalization at the same time.  With the increase 
proposed by the USClS, a family of four would confront a bill amounting to $2,700.  An 
exorbitant price tag should not stand in the way of families seeking to realize the 
American Dream. 

I do not oppose applicants paying a fee to apply for U.S.  citizenship and commend the 
USCIS for taking the steps to improve custmner services and processing times.  I also 
understand that the agency believes it needs to raise fees to pay for major infrastructure 
investments and process enhancements, such as improvements in the timeliness of 
background checks, modernization of its outdated business systems, facilities 
improvements and enhancements in its personnel training and recruitment programs. 
However, placing the full costs of these investments on the back of o w  nation's  legal 
permanent residents is driving fees to a level that immigrants simply cannot afford. 

I urge the USCIS to work with the President and Congress to obtain appropriations to 
supplement fee revenue to cover costs of major USCIS expenses such as infrastructure 
investments, process enhancements and capital improvements.  In the past, Congress has 
appropriated monies to assist the USCIS in facing challenges such as its application 
processing backlog,  The USCIS believes it needs to make significant investments to 
build an Immigration Service for the 21''  Century.  This is precisely the type of challenge 
that should be met through the partnership between applicants paying a reasonable fee 
and the appropriation of Congressional funding.

Immigrants who apply for U.S. citizenship are eager to demonstrate their commitment to 
this countn, by becoming full particiuants in our nation's civic life.  If they cannot 
become U.S. citizens because bfan i f a i r  fee hike. we will all lose an opiortunit, to 
strengthen and revitalize our democracy.  Our nation has a tradition of welcoming 
newcomers because of their contributions to our economic and social promess. The 
USCIS' proposed fee increase is contrary to the spirit of this traditionkcisends 
newcomers the wrong message at a time when they are seeking to embrace 
U.S. citizenship.  I urge you to halt the proposed naturalization fee increase, and seek 
appropriated funding to help cover the investments the USCIS needs to provide quality 
services at an affordable price. 

Thank you for your consideration of my views.
