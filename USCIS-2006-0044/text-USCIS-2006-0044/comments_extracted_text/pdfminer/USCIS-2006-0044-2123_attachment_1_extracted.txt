 Director, Regulatory Management Division: 

It is highly immoral to increase the fees without reducing the processing 
time for each applications/petitions. Business people must be more taxed 
than ordinary people. For example USCIS charge only $190.00 to employe and 
alien worker in US who is normally being paid $50,000 plus. USCIS charge 
$400.00 to apply to become a US citizen from an ordinary LPR person. USCIS 
should charge more from business people and companies since they are 
making more money. It is unfair and un ethical to increase the fee so as 
to affect the ordinary people. We need to remember Emma Lazarus when she 
said "Give me your tired, your poor,  Your huddled masses yearning to 
breathe free,   The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.   Send these, 
the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me:   I lift my lamp beside the golden 
door." 

Sincerely, 

Lal Varghese, Attorney at Law
