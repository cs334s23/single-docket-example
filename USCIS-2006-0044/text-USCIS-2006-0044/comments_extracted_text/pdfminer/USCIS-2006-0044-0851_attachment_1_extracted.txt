The proposed increase in fees for those applying for US citizenship is the latest in a series 
of anti-immigrant proposals and a travesty of moral and social justice.  The fees are 
already high, particularly for the majority of the population that is making application.  
To triple them only constructs a second wall to prevent immigration.  And there is no 
logical reason for this.  The agency should be funded by the government in the same way 
that other government agencies are. 

The INS/CIS has long been a broken beaurocratic vehicle, as witnessed by the inordinate 
length of time applicants must wait to be processed, as witnessed by the newspaper report 
several years ago of boxes of applications being tossed.  Overhaul of this system is long 
overdue, but not at the expense of those least prepared to pay for it.
