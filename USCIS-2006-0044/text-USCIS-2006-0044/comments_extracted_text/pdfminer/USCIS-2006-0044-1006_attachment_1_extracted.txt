Subject: New Fees for Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Applications 

To the Director, Regulatory Management Division of US Citizenship and Immigration 
Services: 

I am writing to urge you to abandon the proposed 66% increase in fees that could 
possibly be imposed upon applicants and petitioners for citizenship and green cards.  I 
believe it is important to make this process more affordable for those who truly want to 
become Americans.  It would seem that raising fees would only encourage people to 
continue seeking illegal entrance to our country.  As far as raising fees to discourage 
terrorists;  if someone wants to kill Americans that badly, they'll find a way.  If the fees 
are being raised to discourage people from becoming citizens in general, then just close 
down immigration, ship all illegals home and bring the US soldiers back from the Middle 
East to patrol our Mexican and Canadian borders. 

Sincerely, 

Marita Justice
