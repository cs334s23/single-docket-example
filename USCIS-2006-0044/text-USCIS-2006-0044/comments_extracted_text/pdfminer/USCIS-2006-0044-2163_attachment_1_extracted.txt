Subject: Fee Increase Proposal  

Dear Director,  

I am writing in regards to the Fee Increase Proposal for documents your office processes 
that are related to international adoption. This fee increase has come to my attention 
through the adoption agency my husband and I are working with to adopt a child from 
China. We urge you to not pass this proposal at this time.  

We started our adoption process in January 2006, and had hoped we would be in China 
by now completing our adoption. The process in China has taken longer than anticipated, 
and timeframes seem to be lengthening. We had expected to be fingerprinted again given 
the timeframes, but we may also have to re-file our I-600. As it looks now, our I-171 may 
expire before we are matched with a child and allowed to travel to bring her home. 
Having to pay the fees twice is hard enough, but having them raised in the process makes 
is even worse.  

Adoption is a very costly, but a worthwhile investment that we chose to do whole-
heartedly. We know there are more fees and expenses ahead of us before completing this 
process, but hope you will not pass this proposal on these particular fees.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Susan and Roger Hunsberger
