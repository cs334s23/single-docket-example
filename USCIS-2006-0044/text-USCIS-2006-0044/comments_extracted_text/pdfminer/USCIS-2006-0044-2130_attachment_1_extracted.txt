 Director, Regulatory Management Division: 

Dear Sir/Madam: 

I would like to address a problem with your Vermont Service Center and 
USCIS customer service Center. Your staff are mistreating, mishandling, 
and lack of customer service. 

I am a US Citizen and I filed for my wife with at your Vermont service 
Center (I-130) about 8 months ago. They are not processing any cases last 
8-12 months. espically these cases are more impacting US Citizen and their 
family. 

I made numerous telephone call to USCIS Customer Service Centers and 
Washington DC Customer Service center. I believe that these staff are 
uneducated about USCIS process and don't care about public because they 
don't answer any questions, I am asking about my cases. In many occasions, 
I ask help from these service center and they refused or they don't know 
what to do or who to speak about cases. 

I hope your deparment can take any actions againt the people who is 
responsible/accountable for this mess. 

Sincerely, 

Mathew Thomas
