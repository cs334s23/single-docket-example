Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I would like to express my concern over the proposed fee increases.  We are struggling to adopt 
our first child via international adoption and are very distressed to learn that not only will we have 
to renew our current paperwork but we may have to pay fees that are considerably higher than 
the original fees.  It is very difficult to come to the point in your life where you realize that you will 
never be able to bear a child of your own, then be slapped in the face with the enormous costs of 
adoption.  What is our country coming too when we make it so difficult for parents to welcome 
children into their homes who otherwise would be forced to grow up in an orphanage?  Please 
reconsider both the length of time these documents are valid for and the cost of getting the 
paperwork done.
