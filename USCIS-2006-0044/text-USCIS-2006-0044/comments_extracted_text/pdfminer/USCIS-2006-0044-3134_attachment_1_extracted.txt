Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am writing to protest the proposed rate increase for immigration documents 
and the Certificate of Citizenship.   As an adoptive parent, I find these fees to 
be way too high for the service provided.  How long does it take one case 
worked to review the documents we submit?  Even if it took an hour, the 
proposed fee would be a ridiculous amount of money to pay someone to review 
documents and send out an approval letter to a family adopting a child.  Even if 
it takes two hours, the fee is already way too high.  And as for the new fee for 
the Certificate of Citizenship--the new fee would be 120% higher than the 
current fee.  How is this justifiable?  Can you guarantee quicker and better 
service?   I've seen this fee rise before, and it hasn't resulted in any 
improvements.  Plus, this document is now given out free of charge to families 
who have brought their children how since 2004.  Why should those of us who 
adopted before 2004 have to pay a huge fee for a document others get free? 
I object to any increase in fees as proposed in Docket no. USCIS-2006-0044. 
Sincerely, 
Sandee McAlpine, adoptive parent
