Emilio Gonzalez 
USCIS Director 

Dear Emilio Gonzalez: 

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services plans to raise the costs of 
applying for American citizenship beyond the reach of many recent 
immigrants. 

During the past 12 years, the application costs have risen 400 percent. 
USCIS has proposed raising the cost of a green card from $325 to $905, a 
citizenship application from $330 to $595 and fingerprinting from $70 to 
$80. 

USCIS is one of the few government agencies that operates primarily on 
user fees, yet it plans to put an additional burden on people already 
working as hard as possible to become lawful U.S. citizens. Naturalization 
for a family of four would rise to $2,430. 

Tell Congress to appropriate the funds necessary to allow thousands of 
hard-working immigrants to gain citizenship at a cost they can afford. 

Sincerely, 

Julie Roberts
