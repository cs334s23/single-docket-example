I fully support raising fees for refugees/immigrants.  This program should be self-supporting, as 
refugees and immigrants are draining enough resources from Americans.  They're sucking our 
school system dry, utilizing medical resources they're not paying for, getting welfare payments for 
years.  They go the emergency room for a common cold, while I can't afford to go there for a 
genuine emergency!   Why should they care. . .they don't pay for it anyhow.  With an average of 
10 kids per family, those costs to the American public quickly mount up. 

Lately I've been reading about how they steal identities from innocent people who then must plow 
their way through layer after layer of bureaucracy to reclaim their own good name.  They actually 
buy birth certificates and social security numbers, for heaven's sake. . .these people are nothing 
but crooks, but their sob stories are getting old.   One thing I've noticed:  I've never seen an 
immigrant or refugee drive an old car. 

If they don't like the fees necessary to fund the program, they should not come here in the first 
place if they're not willing to pay their way.  Or if they persist in coming here, they always have 
the freedom to return to their home country.   My ancestors were immigrants, but I can tell you 
they did not get off the boat and head for the welfare office like these Hmongs and Somalis.  They 
also didn't refuse to do an honest day's work, like those Muslims.  They lived hard lives, and 
earned every penny.
