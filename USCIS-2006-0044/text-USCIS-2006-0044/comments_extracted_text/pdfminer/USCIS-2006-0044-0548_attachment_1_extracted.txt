Subject: comments on USCIS-2006-0044-0001 

Dear federal officers: 

I am fully supporting the proposed rule (USCIS-2006-0044-0001) regarding Adjustment 
of the Immigration Benefit Application/ Petition and Biometric Fee Schedule proposed 
by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). I hoped that USCIS can support 
themselves with those fees and process all the forms in the timely manner (within 6 
months). Taxpayers should not pay USCIS.  

In addition, I expected that all forms should be submitted on-line.  Without increased 
fees, USCIS will be unable to upgrade their infrastructure. Sooner the fees are increased, 
the better their services. 

Sincerely, 

Dongyun Yang, a taxpayer and immigration benefit applicant
