Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I would like to voice my concern about the raising of fees for filing a petition and biometric fees.  
During the course of adoption, many families already have to get fingerprints taken 2 – 3 times.  
Each time, there is a charge associated with running the prints through the different government 
databases.  None of the government agencies currently talk to one another.  In my situation and 
many others, the length of time it takes to complete an adoption causes the I-171H to become 
outdated.  This requires that you re-file and re-pay all the fees again.  These fees, along with 
agency, orphanage, and home study fees are great.  There is a tax incentive, however, it will only 
cover about ½ of the true costs of adoption. 

Children are important.  They need to find homes with willing families.  Monetary resources 
should not become a barrier to adoption.   

Sincerely, 

Rebecca S. Holmquist
