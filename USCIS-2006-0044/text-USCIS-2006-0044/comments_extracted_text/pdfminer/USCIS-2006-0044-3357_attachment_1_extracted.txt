To Whom It May Concern: 

On behalf of the New World Symphony, we submit these comments in response to the 
proposed rule published in 72 Fed. Reg. 888-4915 (February 1, 2007) to adjust the 
immigration and naturalization benefit application and petition fee schedule.  We object to the 
proposed increase of the filing fees for nonimmigrant worker petitions. 

Please see the attached letter, and thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Beth Boleyn, Howard Herring, Paul Woehrle, and Douglas Merilatt 
The New World Symphony
