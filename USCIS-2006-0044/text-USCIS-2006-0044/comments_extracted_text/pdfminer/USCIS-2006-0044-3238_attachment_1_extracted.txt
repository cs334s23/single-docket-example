Subject: adoptions 

I want to express my disapproval to the rate increase for adoptions.  We 
have neighbors who have adopted 2 girls from China, given them a good home, 
been loving parents and most especially never asked for any help from any 
agency. 
They are now trying to adopt another child  (with special needs) like their 
second child, and the price to adopt is being raised.  I ask you to rethink 
this. 
These people are adopting children out of the goodness of their hearts. 
They don't ask for much, but adding to their expenses puts a further burden 
on them. Please reconsider. 
Thank you, 
Kristen and JP Aragon
