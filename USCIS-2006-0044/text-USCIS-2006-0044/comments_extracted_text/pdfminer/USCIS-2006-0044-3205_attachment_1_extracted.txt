Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am in the process of adopting a child from Ethiopia, and I would ask that you please 
reconsider increasing the USCIS fees so drastically. The decision to adopt is weighted 
with financial pressure already, and for many people, this new fee schedule would make 
international adoption impossible.  

While I do appreciate all the government does to insure that children enter this country 
safely, increased fees will seemingly increase criminal activity as parents grow desperate 
to bring their children home. Please reconsider this astronomical increase.  

Thank you for hearing my request.
