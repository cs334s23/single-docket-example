I oppose the recent proposal to increase the naturalization fees.  We  
are a middle-class family and have already paid all kinds of fees for  
my husband's immigration to the US-- the fiance visa fee, the work  
visa, the fingerprinting fee, the conditional residency fee, the  
fingerprinting fee to correct the name on the green card, the  
petition to remove residency fee, and a few others I've forgotten  
about now.  I am an American citizen and shouldn't have to pay so  
many fees for the simple fact that I fell in love with someone who  
was born across a border.  Increasing the naturalization fee is  
irresponsible, as I can't imagine how working-class families manage  
to pay such a hefty amount when we, who have more means, find it  
difficult to put that amount together.   Naturalization should be  
FREE- after all that a person did to come to this country and  
contribute to the economy and culture.  The fact that they want to be  
citizens, participating members of our political system, should be a  
source of pride for us.  That is, we should not discourage a person  
from naturalizing by raking the fees up and thus leaving many more to  
the in-between status of residency.  Please consider that you are  
hurting American citizens both directly and indirectly by charging us  
money we work hard to invest in the American economy.
