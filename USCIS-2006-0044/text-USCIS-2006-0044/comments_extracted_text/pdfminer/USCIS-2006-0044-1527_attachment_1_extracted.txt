To Whom It May Concern: 

I read with great interest the information in the above mentioned docket for the proposed petition 
for fee increases. We are the adoptive parents of 3 Chinese children soon to be 4 so we have 
used the services of INS now USCIS to complete these adoptions.  We STRONGLY oppose fee 
increases for the I-600a and the N-600 certificates.  We have used the services of INS/USCIS 
Baltimore in 1999, 2002, 2005 and just recently last month for our current adoption. The services 
we have received have always been sadly very poor.  We have submitted our I-600a applications 
in person at the Baltimore office for 3 of our 4 adoptions.  From the security people that check you 
in the building to the staff that takes your application, the employees have always been rude and 
in no hurry to assist their customers and it was no different last month.  For our adoption in 2005, 
our home study was lost twice delaying our childâ€™s entry into the United States.  We have found 
that you have to call the office handling the Orphan Petitions (if you are able to get a phone 
number and point of contact) to stay on top of things since the mail system is helter skelter and 
again they seem to be in no hurry either.  With this kind of service we see no valid reason to 
increase these fees.  The vast majority of families adopting children internationally are regular 
middle class people as we are who are scrimping and saving to make adoption a reality. The I-
600a has the highest fee currently and with such poor service, we see no reason to increase 
these fees. Give adoptive parents a break and leave the fees alone. Thank you for your 
consideration in this matter. 

Sincerely,
