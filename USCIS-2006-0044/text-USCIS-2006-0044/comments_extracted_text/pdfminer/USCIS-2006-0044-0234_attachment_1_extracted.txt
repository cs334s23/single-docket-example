Director, Regulatory Management Division, U.S. Citizen & Immigration Services, 

I read the article in today's paper and I think and support the idea of raising the cost 
for all of them! It's about time. And it should be higher for legal  residence and 
citizenship. 

There should be no debate, just raise it and keep raising it to cover our costs. 
We need to be more selective who we let in this country, and a limit per year. 

Thanks for the good work.
