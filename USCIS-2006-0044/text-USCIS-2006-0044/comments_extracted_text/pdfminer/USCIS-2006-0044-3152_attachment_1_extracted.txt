RE:       U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services       Docket Number USCIS-2006- 0044 

Dear Sir or Madam: 

I strongly object to the proposed increase in fees for international adoption.  An international 
adoption already costs ten of thousands of dollars, and to increase the fees charged by the 
Federal Government for the right to wade through the red tape are completely unnecessary.  Of 
all the things the Federal government could tax, I estimate that giving homes to orphans should 
be at the bottom of the list!
