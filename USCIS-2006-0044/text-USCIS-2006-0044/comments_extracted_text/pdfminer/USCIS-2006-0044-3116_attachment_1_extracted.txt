Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

The increase of fees, especially those fees associated with adoption, are punitive to adoptive 
parents.  Especially with adoption now taking longer, familes have to pay those fees 
twice.  To increase fees over 140% places an undue financial burden on families trying to adopt 
and may make it impossible for some to adopt.  Please reconsider the fee increase and please do 
not increase the fees.
