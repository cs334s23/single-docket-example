Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 
I respectfully request that the above referenced Proposed Rule be abandoned due to the 
increased financial burden to American Families.  So many hard working and loving people are 
trying to bring these forgotten children into loving homes.  Additional financial burdens are not 
needed.  These proposed rules would make the hurdles in front of these families even harder to 
cross. 

Sincerely, 

Sarah Foster
