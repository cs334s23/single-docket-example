Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

Dear Sir/Madam, 
My name is Muluneh Yohannes Ayalew. 
Seattle, WA 
I am forwarding my comments on two grounds: 
ONE:-I am pleased to know about cutting the waiting list on immigration services. It was 
painful...i even had to wait for about three years to be set for an Asylum interview. I still 
have to wait one more year to apply for I-485. So i am hoping things will move faster this 
time. 

TWO:- worry points, i spend most of my time in the social services with immigrant 
communities. Life is tough! The planned increase of fee will adversely affect low income 
immigrant families severely...It is a fact that most of the beneficiaries of the services of 
the immigration are naturally, immigrants. THE PLANNED INCREASE OF COST IS 
TOO MUCH. It should have been a gradual increase of cost than a SUDDEN 
SURPRISE. It will even damage my budget let alone many people living with minimum 
wage levels. 

The other question is, i don't think the agency can provide definite timelines to execute 
specific files. People like me will first look when the case will be done and how much am 
i going to pay... Can you provide your projections to the public with fee and time in to 
consideration please??? 

MY RECOMMENDATION: USCIS shall rather increase fee gradually, like in every two 
years or so instead of imposing everything at one time. I expect a lot of uproar in so many 
corners related with the fee. 

I hope you will give attention to recommendations you get, 

Regards, 

Muluneh Yohannes.
