Subject: Please raise citizenship fees! 

To whom it may concern; 

Please raise citizenship fees. I feel anyone who wants to become an American citizen should 
work to earn the right. Earning the right to be a citizen, means more than paying a fee. For the 
past 3 generations of my family have served in the military. I did not serve on active duty. But I 
served in a support position as a Naval Command Ombudsman and military spouse for 12 years. 
Pride of citizenship is more than paying a simple fee. It means sacrifice. New citizens need to 
acknowledge the process to become a citizen is expensive and the costs associated with 
background checks and paperwork must be covered by immigrants if they want to become 
citizens. Crying about the expense is petty when citizenship offers them the ability to utilize 
governmental grant programs and other such benefits. Raising the price for citizenship is merely 
weeding out the bleeding hearts! 

Sincerely, 
Naomi Magneson Johnson
