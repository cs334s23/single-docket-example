Subject: USCIS-2006-0044- fee increase for International Adoption 

To whom it may concern: 

My husband and I are US citizens in the process of international adoption from Vietnam 
and China.  The proposed fee increase will cause unnecessary financial hardship at a time 
when we are already facing increased debt for wanting to help an orphan.   

Wait times for referrals for international adoptions are taking much longer.  We will have 
to completely refile for a new I-171H at least once for China and possibly a second time 
for Vietnam as well.   I have long been in favor of increasing the timeline for the I-171H, 
and that has yet to happen.  Increasing the fees, with no increase in services, only adds 
insult to injury.   

What it used to cost to file for an I-171H: 
I600A: $545 
Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140 
Total: $685 

What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase: 
I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340 
Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320 
Total: $1660 

That's an increase of $975 or over 140%!  This is unacceptable.  Please reconsider the fee 
increase, and increase the length of time for which the I-171H is valid.
