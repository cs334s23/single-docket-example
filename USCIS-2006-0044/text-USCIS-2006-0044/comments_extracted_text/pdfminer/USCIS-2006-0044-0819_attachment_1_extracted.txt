Subject: USCIS 2006 0044 

My husband and I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to adopt a foreign child since 2002 
from Poland, Ukraine and now China.  At present we are awaiting a referral with hope of 
receiving one this summer.  In the quest to adopt a child, we have had to renew or reapply 
for a USCIS documents 4 times so far.  As our document for the China adoption will 
expire before we adopt our daughter, we have to reapply once again, making this number 
5. I feel the unnecessary costs are unjust.  There should be some allowance given to 
families who were not able to adopt a child due to international circumstances beyond 
their control.  To simply charge these exorbitant fees without providing a service in 
return is unjust.  I feel that increasing the fees is unjustified and wrong.  My fingerprints 
and USCIS document expire in June.  At that time I have no choice but to reapply in 
order to bring my daughter home. 
My hope would be for USCIS to grant waiting families and extension.  At the very least, 
the fees should remain the same for those families with dossiers already in progress. 

Sincerely, 

Barbara Friedel
