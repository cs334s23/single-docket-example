I am sendng this e-mail to inform you that I object to the proposed fee increase.  Immigration has 
a history of increasing fees without giving the applicants real benefits.  The processing of cases 
does not get any better.  Customer services still leave little to desire.  They are rude and not 
helpful enough.   You would beleive that with the added fees qualified personnel would be hired.   

Sacramento Office has rude and anti-immigrant employees who seize any opportunity to deny 
applicants of their rights to immigrate their relatives.  They make hastey decisions and cause 
applicants to spend hundreds of dollars in attorney fees to protect their rights 

I object to this unfair practice of increasing fees at the expense of the poor people who are 
struggling to survive financially and now the burden of meeting such high prices to legalize their 
families.
