Docket number (USCIS-2006-0044). 
Concerning United States Citizenship and Immigration Services 

This email concerns the increase of fees for USCIS. The fees are already very high and 
are sometimes prohibitive for American families to provide good homes to children that 
need them. 

Please consider the plight of the children and keep the fees at the current level or lower 
them.  

Thank you for your thoughtful attention to this very important matter. 

Major and Mrs. Gregory T. Reich
