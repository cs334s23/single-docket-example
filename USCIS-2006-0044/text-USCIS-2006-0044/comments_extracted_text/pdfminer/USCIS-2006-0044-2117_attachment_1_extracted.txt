Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am totally opposed to the proposed increase in USCIS fees.   

Here are some of the reasons: 

•        The integrity of low-income families should not be sacrificed in a “business 
decision” – the justification given for the increases.  Example: Naturalization 
applications for a family of four at or just above the poverty line would cost 10 
percent of annual income.  Faced with the proposed $595 naturalization fee (up 80 
percent from $330), parents should not have to choose which child can apply for 
citizenship versus another. 

•        An individual earning minimum wage would have to save an entire month’s pay 
to file a $1,370 application to adjust from temporary to permanent residence (up 
661 percent from $180).   

•        Vulnerable individuals who qualify for T-visas (I-914) and under the Violence 

Against Women Act would also suffer from the proposed increases, despite their 
initial fees being waived.  With these increases, many could not afford to adjust 
their status, apply for work permits, or reunify their families, and could face 
deportation or elongated detention.  

•        Since the nature of government services lacks the price-control mechanisms 

present in competitive markets, such services that impact people’s lives should 
not be treated as a “business decision.”  

•        Such large marginal increases are unprecedented, unnecessary and detrimental to 

the pursuit of the American dream. 

•        Immigrants paying these fees are law-abiding individuals who pay taxes, 

contribute to their communities, speak English and know American history.  We 
all benefit from increases in legal immigration and citizenship – economically and 
culturally.  Immigrants should be encouraged, not hindered from applying for and 
maintaining legal status.
