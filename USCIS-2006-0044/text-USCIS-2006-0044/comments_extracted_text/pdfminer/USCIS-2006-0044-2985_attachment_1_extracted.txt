Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am emailing to comment on the proposed changes to adoption fees.  After looking at these 
proposed increases, I was shocked.  My husband and I are hoping to adopt at some time but 
have already put it off for the time being because we simply cannot afford to do so.  And we are 
not paying off a $800,000 home or $50,000 vehicle either!  We live modestly and simply; but even 
without living extravagantly adopting a child is not an option for us yet.  The financial aspects are 
just too daunting.  These proposed changes will add hundreds of dollars onto the amount of 
money we will need to do this.  These are children's lives on the line; sometimes; or their 
physical, mental, and emotional health for the remainder of their lives.  Adoption is already a 
difficult, invasive process for the adoptive family--why make it even more daunting by adding 
extra expenses to it?  Why add more obstacles for families who are willing to take these needy 
kids and give them a loving home and family?  Let some government officials give up part of their 
salary or lunches on Uncle Sam's tab to save the money this extra revenue would generate.  
These kids who are waiting to be adopted don't have expensive houses, and some of them don't 
get lunches every day.  Let the lawmakers who came up with these fee changes skip a few 
lunches here and there--maybe downsize their homes or cars.  Don't take it from needy kids or 
families who are trying to help them!
