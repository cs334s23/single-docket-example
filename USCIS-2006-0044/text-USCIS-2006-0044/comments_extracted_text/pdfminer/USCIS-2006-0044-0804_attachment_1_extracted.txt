Subject: fee increase 

I write to object very strongly to the level of fee increases.  It is unfair and extremely 
outrageously high.  What is the rational for making the fees so high, especially when it is 
not going to make any difference with the quality service. A little increase is fine but 50-
100 % increase, with no improvement in services is unfair.  There are people right now 
whose applications have been a year after finger printing and have not heard a word from 
your office.
