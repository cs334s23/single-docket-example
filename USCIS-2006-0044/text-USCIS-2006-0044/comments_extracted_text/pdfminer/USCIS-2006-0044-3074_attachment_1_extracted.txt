Subject: Docket # USCIS-2006- 0044 

It has been brought to our attention that USCIS is currently reviewing a proposal to 
increase application and petition fees that will affect(among other things) the already-
high cost of pursuing international adoptions.  Please consider those who are undertaking 
the call to help orphans around the world have what should be every child's right--a place 
to call home.  Personally, we've found DHS to be well-run agency which was prompt in 
response to our previously submitted paperwork and were pleased at its consideration of 
additional months before I-171H documents expired.  The adoption process which for us 
began January 2006 is a lesson in patience and trust.  A journey I would not trade. 
However, the cost involved is already very steep and, because of the long wait, we(like 
most others) are looking at updating our paperwork again shortly with that added 
expense.  Please choose not to raise fees! 

Thank you for your consideration. 
Very respectfully, 
Susie Walrond
