Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern; 

I am writing this email to let it be known that I am strongly AGAINST raising 
the fees for paper work/filings/petitions necessary for  international adoptions. We 
are currently adopting a child internationally and this is already a VERY expensive 
process.  We have been very blessed and want to give a child currently living in an 
orphange a chance at a better life, with a loving family, but with the escalating costs 
it makes adoption more difficult for families.  Please reconsider raising these fees. 
Keep in mind all of the children waiting for a family and help make it more attainable 
by not adding to the already high cost of adoption. 

Thank you- 
Shannon Strong
