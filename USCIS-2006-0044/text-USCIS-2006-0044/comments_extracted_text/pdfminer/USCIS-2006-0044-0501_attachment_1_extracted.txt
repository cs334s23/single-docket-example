Subject: fee increase 

To whom it may concern: 

We understand the fees to process the I600-A form are increasing significantly.  We are 
greatly opposed to this for the following reasons.  First, your service is extremely slow.  
It is worse in some areas of the country than others.  I know some people in the Atlanta 
area have been waiting for months for their forms to be processed.  Those of us who are 
adopting from China are waiting up to 18 months for a referral which means we need to 
file twice.  That means we have to pay twice which is also unfair.  If you are going to 
increase the fees, then at least do it after legislation has passed to extend the validity of 
the I171-H.  Now it is only valid for 18 months and fingerprints expire even sooner.  If 
you are going to increase the fees, at least make your services better to justify it.
