Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS- 2006-0044  

RE: Adjustment of the Immigration Benefit Application/ Petition and Biometric Fee 
Schedule  

Part of this adjustment is for the current fee to apply for permanent residency is $325; 
CIS proposes to raise this fee to $905 (a 178 percent increase). I believe this and some of 
the other increases are excessive and unfair. This will adversely affect many 
working families in America, not just immigrants, but they're immediate and 
extended families who are already native or naturalized Americans. 

I don't believe such a fee increase would be acceptable for other government 
agencies, so it should not be allowed for this one either.

I urge your agency to work with Congressional leaders to identify an alternative and 
permanent funding stream that supports your operations.

Thank you,
