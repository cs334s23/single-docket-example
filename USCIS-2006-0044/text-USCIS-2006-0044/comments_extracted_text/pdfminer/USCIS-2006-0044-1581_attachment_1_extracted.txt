Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Dear ladies and gentlemen, 

The practice has proved that raising application fee is not an effective way to reduce 
immigrants from other countries. I oppose raising the fees. 

The most effective way is : 
1) making the immigrant law, regulations, policy and rules more strict, especially on the 
non-immediate family relatives. 
2) No more special pardon to illegal immigrants; 
3) Deport illegal immigrants, simplify the law and procedure on the deportation.
