Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To whom it may concern, 
    I have just learned of the proposed rate increase for the USCIS 
documents related to international adoption.  Not only am I worried 
about the increase in fees, but I am also unhappy about the percent 
increase that is being proposed.  Adoption is a very expensive endeavor 
as it is.  After six years of infertility and taking out various loans, 
we have been able to begin realizing our dreams of becoming a family 
through adoption.  With the new fee increases, once we have our twin 
boys home, it will be difficult to find the money to readopt them, 
change their names or follow through with making them a citizen of this 
country.  We are patriotic Americans who support this country and make 
it a point to vote in every election.  We would like to raise our sons 
to be the same kind of devoted American citizens.  We hope that you will 
please consider not raising the fees on adoption related paperwork.  In 
the end, it will cost many children from finding homes because the 
average family will not be able to afford an adoption.  If the fees must 
be elevated, then please do it to a lessor extent. 
Thank you for your time, 
Dr. and Mrs. Michael C. Cruz
