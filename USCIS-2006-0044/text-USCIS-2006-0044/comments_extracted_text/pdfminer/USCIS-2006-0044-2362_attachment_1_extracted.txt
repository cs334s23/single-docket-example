Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I would like to comment that my wife and I have been considering adoption for a few 
months now.  We have struggled with infertility and desire to have another child.  As we 
continue looking into the adoption process it is very discouraging to us in how much it 
will cost.  We are an average American family who manages our money very wisely.  
However, the costs may prohibit us from being able to fulfill our ultimate dream to 
expand our family.  

Iâ€™m writing to ask you to please refrain from increasing the application fee schedule for 
immigrants. 

Thank you for your consideration! 

Sincerely, 
Stacy Tedrick
