Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

Increasing costs by 100% is unreasonable. For a typical process it currently 
costs $765 - $800, with the new increament it will now cost over $1600.. 

What would the benefits of increasing costs by this much be? (2 months less 
than actual) 
I'm certain that if USCIS asks petitioners that they could save 66% of their 
cost if they wait 2 - 3 months petitionerwill agree to wait.. 

It would be nice if UCSIC could provide a detail report of how this extra 
increase is going to be used. With figures and detailed information of how 
this extra increase is going to be deployed. 

What are the goals of a 21 Centrury USCIS (Describe in detail) 
When should the plublic start noticing the change (eliminating backlogs, 
faster service, efficiency etc)
