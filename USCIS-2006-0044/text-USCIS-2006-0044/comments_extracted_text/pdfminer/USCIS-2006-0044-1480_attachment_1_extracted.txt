Subject: Please Do Not Increase Service Fees-docket number (USCIS-2006-0044) 

Please do not increase the service fees this drastically.  This will just make it harder for low-
income immigrants to become law abiding citizens.  I do not see any reason why these increases 
have to be so high so quickly.  I can understand a gradual increase but this seems extreme.  
Please reconsider! 

Sincerely,  
Mary
