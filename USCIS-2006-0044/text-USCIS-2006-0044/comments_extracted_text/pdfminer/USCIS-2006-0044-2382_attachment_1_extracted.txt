Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Dear Madam, Sir, 

I wish to raise my voice in protest to the proposed increase in the 
processing fees for orphan petitions. As I understand it, the fees are to 
increase as follows: 

I-600/600A 
Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative 
From: $ 545 
To:   $ 670 

I am currently in the process of readying myself for an adoption and have 
already filed my I-600A, so I will not be affected by the proposed changes. 
Nevertheless, this increase in fees, to my mind, is irresponsible and family 
hostile. Adoption is a very taxing process and tremendously expensive to 
boot. Your proposed change in fees represents an increase of more than 20%, 
which is unconscionable in that it significantly adds to the financial 
hardships prospective adoptive parents already face. Adoptive parents need 
support, not a callous assault on their pocketbooks. Many adoptive parents 
go into debt in order to pursue their dream of building a new family. The 
proposed fee increase will only add to the financial burden, and if 
anything, our government should not be in the business of threatening the 
financial security of aspiring families. 

I urge you to refrain from implementing the fee change. 

Thank you for your attention.
