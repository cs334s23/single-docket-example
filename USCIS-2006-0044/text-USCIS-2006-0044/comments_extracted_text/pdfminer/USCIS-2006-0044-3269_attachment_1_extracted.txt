Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern; 

I am writing to express my extreme dismay at the proposed increase in CIS fees associated with adoption. 
Currently, the system is fraught with so many bureaucratic delays and expenses, that even changing the 
name on my child's certificate of citizenship, which should be his legal right to obtain, will be cost 
prohibitive. He is a legal citizen of this country, and has a certificate of citizenship, but his legal first name 
has since changed. That this may soon cost up to $400 to process, when there seems to be nothing involved 
besides noting a name change. 

Thank you for considering this petition agains this fee adjustment.
