Dear Sir: 

We are wriling to comment on the [Jnited  States Citizenship and Immigration's proposed rule lo 
increase the fees of the Immigration Examinations Fee Account.  72 Fed  Reg. 4888 (Feb  I. 
2007)  The proposed rule seeks to increasc the fee for the I-600fI-600A from $545 lo $665.  For 
the reasons stated below. we are opposed to the fee increases as they pertain to the 1-600A-600A 
fees. 

Thc prcamblc to thc proposcd rule states that the "currrm~ fws do not rellect current processes or 
recover thc full costs of scrviccs that should bc provided." 72 Fed. Reg. 4888.  Thc prcamblc also 
states that Llre  I'ee increase "will ensure sutficient funding to meet immediate national securily, 
customer service, and standard processing time goals, and to sustain and improve service 
delivery." Id 

Furthcr, thc prcamblc to thc proposcd mlc states that thc fcc incrcasc reflects thc allocation ol' 
surcharges and routine processing costs "evenly across for times for which fees are char,qed" and 
t h a ~  a portion or the fee increase is for "broader investments in a new technolo~y and business 
proccss platfor~n to irnprovc substantially [USCIS'S] capabilities and scrvicc Icvcls." Id. 

Wc havc rcad through thc cntirc prcamblc and thc proposcd rulc, and wc do not bclicvc that 
increasing the I'ce Tor  the I-boon-600A  is a reawnable way for USCIS to attempt to meet these 
goals.

USCIS calculated the proposed  fee of $665 in  thc following manncr: 

111lbrm llie public: tclcphonc assistancc. 110s

complete the forms, explain procedures 

Intake:  mail, filing, data entry, fee receipting.

All  of thc line items e x 9 1  for the amount allocated to "makc dctcrmination" arc the same as for 
all other applications and petitions.  Wc belicvc that allocating costs this way this 
disproporiionately and unfairly placcs the burdcn of thcsc cxpcnscs on adopting parents -- whose 
applications comprisc only 0.6% of the fee-payins volume -- without any corresponding benefit. 

For example. it  is clear from looking through thc tables in the preamble that the  I-60011-600A 
program does not suffer from a backlog likc many other petitions and appliciltions,  l'ablc 3 statcs 
that it takcs only 3.39 months to process thc 1-600/1-600A -- well undw the President's goal of 6 
months.  Moreover, thc fact that it only takes IlSClS gaff 1.53 hours to complete an application 
indicates that the 3.39-month processing timc may  be the result ofwaiting for applicants to 
providc all  of the rcquircd inhrmation rather because of a backlog of applications.'  In  general, 
adopting parents sccm to expcricnce only a &week  processing time (or shorter) from the timc 
USCIS has all of thc rcquircd information.  Any customer servicc cnhanccmcnts paid  Tor  by  the

I t  is common for 1-600/!-600A  applicanls to submit their applications bcforc thcir homc 
study is complete, in order to obtain a biomettics appointment whilc waiting for thcir home study 
to bc finalized  170r example, we submitted our 1-600/1-600A application on June 2. 2006, but did 
no1 si~bmit our home study until July 3, 2006  Thc nolicc of favorable determination (1-1 71 W) 
was issued on August  15. 2006,  This is almost exactly 6 wccks from the time our application was 
cornplclc.

Tee  incrcasc will do littlc to improvc thc already acceptable completion rates For  the I-600/1-600A 
Rather, thc increased fees will fund review of n&er  applications. which sccms contrary to the 
intcnt of OM13's gu~dancc 

In addition, unlike most of the other petitions and applications affected by  the proposcd mlc,  I -  
60011-600A applications do not  involvc any national security concerns.  Only United  States 
citizens may apply Tor  the I-600/1-600A.  and any non-citizcn  spouse is required to have 
pcrmancnt  rcsidcnt status (which ensures that thty have already been scrccncd rbr  national 
sccurity concerns).  Morcovcr, a foreign-born orphan poses none of the security risks of 
pctitioncrs or applicants for other types of USCIS authorizations.  Thus. allocating $18 l'or  IBIS 
checks seems to be unlhirly applied becauw there is no nccd  to scrccn applicants for national 
sccurity issues or cross-rcfcrcnec them against Federal lookout systems.'  Consequently, customer 
scrvicc cnhancemcnts dcsigncd to enhance national security systems or otherwist: address national 
sccurity concerns will  not benefit the 1-600/1600A applicants or provide them with enhatlccd 
service, rhus I-60011-600A  applicants should not  havc pay  for associatcd proccssing activities. 

Other processing activities that  I-600/1-600A  applicants would be required  to pay for under the 
proposed rule include inf'nrming the public and reviewing records.  The I-60011-600A I'orm is 
quite simple, and the preamble contains no information to indicate the number of calls. if any. to 
thc national custorncr scwicc ccntcr or the 110s that conccrn this application or how to fill out thc 
required Ibrm.  Similarly, the preamble contains nothing to demonstrate that the "review records" 
activity ber~elits I-600-/I-600A applicants, such as the number of FOIA requests that  concern 1- 
60011-600A applications, or the percentage OF Federal records storage space necessary for 
processed I-60011-600A.  Consequently, both of thcse fccs sccm unfairly allocated to 1-60011- 
hOOA  applicants. 

The otllcr custorner service enhancements, security enhancements, humanitarian cnhanccmcnts, 
and intiastructurc cnhanccmcnts similarly provide littlc or no bcncfit to 1-60011-600A applicants 
Moreover, it seems irriltional to require I-600/1-600A applicants to shoulder the burdcn of fcc 
waivcrs and asylumlrcfu~cc cxpcnscs (which comprisc ovcr halt'orthe  % 120 L'ee increase) when 
neithcr of thcsc options is available for people who cannot pay the 1-60011-600A fcc. 

In sum, increasing the 1-60011-600A fec on thcse bascs docs not  sccm rationally rclatcd to ihe cost 
recovery goals that purportedly support the Fcc increase. and we believe that  USCIS should 
rccvaluatc thc increase to relieve the Tee  burden on adopting parents. 

In thc altcrnativc, we urge IJS(:IS  to consider adrling a provision in thc final rulc that waives thc 
I-600/1-600A I'eu w d  t.he hiometncs fee for any applicants who must  rcapply bccausc their

applications "to ensure that theunited States is not  placcd at risk by  railing to idcntify individuals

othcr pctitioncr or applicant, still without enjoying any of the benefits of the service, security, or

"t 

is unclear why  I-60011-600A applicants should he required to pay the hll biornetncs 

fcc whcti their fingerprint clearance expires while waiting for the atloption to complete. 
Fingctpr^inlin& is done electroni~dly and the agency alrwdy has thc applicants' biomctric 
iaformation stored id its computer.  Howcvcr, USCIS rcgi~lations do not coniemplate the 
possibility thdt adopting parents will need to be fingcrprintcd morc than oncc and thus thc 
applicants and the asency are required to expend their time and rcsourccs to collect information 
that the agcncy xlrcady has. 

4  Another alternative which is not directly implicated by thc proposcd rulc is to incrcnsc 
Lhe  validity period for the I-600fl-600A approval from 18 months to 36  months. but no lcss than 
24 months.
