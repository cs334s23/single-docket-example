I am opposed to the Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Application and 
Petition Fee Schedule.  The increased fee would place an additional hardship on many 
individuals, as it is already doing so at the current fee. 

As parents seeking to complete an international adoption, we will need to renew our application at 
least twice before the adoption is completed.  This is quite expensive and will be even more so if 
the fee is increased. 

Please DO NOT adjust the immigrant and naturalization benefit application fees!!!
