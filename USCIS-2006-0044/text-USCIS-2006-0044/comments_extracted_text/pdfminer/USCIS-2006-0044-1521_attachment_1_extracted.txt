To USCIS directors and policy makers: 

I write to protest the raising of immigration fees.  I also write to support the enactment of the 
Citizenship Promotion Act (S. 795 and H.R. 1379) which would: 

• 

require that USCIS administer the citizenship test uniformly, while providing due 
consideration to the education and other circumstances of the applicant;  

•  mandate that any electronic application filing system USCIS puts into place be voluntary;  
set up reporting requirements regarding name checks for citizenship applicants;  
• 
•  and most important, establish a national New Americans Initiative, authorized at $80 
million per year, that would promote citizenship and fund community efforts to assist 
immigrants with their citizenship applications.   

 While I realize that we live in difficult times, complicated by budgetary constraints, it seems most 
inappropriate to place an even larger financial burden on those who are working to achieve 
citizenship status in the U.S., namely the immigrants themselves. 

Instead of raising fees, I urge you to consider requesting budget increases from Congress to 
handle this sensitive and worthy cause of how best to manage the widening numbers of 
immigrants.  Our history is replete with examples of how immigrants have been involved in 
literally building this country from its earliest days.  Our contemporary immigrants continue to be 
closely involved in the work of building and maintaining our society, often at the bottom rungs of 
society.  They deserve fair and affordable treatment. 

Sincerely, 

Rev. William E. Hutchison, Pastor
