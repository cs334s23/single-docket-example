Shame on President Bush and the Administration for taking advantage of the current 
animosity toward illegal immigrants (hispanics in particular) by proposing the outrageous 
66 per cent increase for immigration services, especially the raise in application for 
permanent residence from $395 to $995.  If this prevails, the Stature of Liberty should 
have its wording changed to "Give me your rich...and  hang her head in shame.
