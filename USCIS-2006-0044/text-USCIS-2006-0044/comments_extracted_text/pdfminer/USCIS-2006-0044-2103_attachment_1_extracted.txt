Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

Please consider that many who want to become US citizens may find the proposed fee increase a 
financial hardship proposed in USCIS-2006-0044. 
I understand that a fee increase may be needed.  I hope you will consider less of an increase and 
maybe build over a few years.   
Thank you for the opportunity to share my concern.
