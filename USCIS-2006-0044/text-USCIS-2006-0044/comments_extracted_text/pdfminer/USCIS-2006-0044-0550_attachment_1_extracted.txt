To whom it may concern, 

I just read that the fees for some of the required paperwork for adopted children may be 
increasing soon. Having 3 adopted children myself, the current fees for the COC, and all 
other fees that were paid to adopt are high enough. 

I think this is so unfair. I understand that costs should be increased to accommodate rising 
costs but please be sensitive to the families who already pay 25,000 and higher to become 
a parent to an adopted child. 

Thank you  

Kind Regards, 

Susanne Stalker
