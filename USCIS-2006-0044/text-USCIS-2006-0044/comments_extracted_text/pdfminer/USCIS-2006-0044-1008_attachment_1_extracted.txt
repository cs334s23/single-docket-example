DHS Docket Number: USCIS-2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 

On  behalf  of  community-based  organizations  serving  Haitian  and  Haitian  Americans 
living  in  Miami-Dade  County,  I  am  writing  to  express  our  serious  concerns  over  the 
United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  (USCIS)  recent  announcement  that 
filing  fees  for  the  most  frequently  filed  petitions  and  applications  may  increase  by  an 
average  of  66%.  What  that  means  in  actual  terms  is  that  the  application  for  citizenship 
will jump from $400 to $595, the application for permanent residence will increase from 
$325 to $905 and  the petition for a relative ( I-130) will increase from $190 to $335. 

I  must  respectfully  state  that  such  a  decision  is  elitist,  undemocratic  and  clearly  favors 
immigrants  with  the  means  to  pay  such  steep  fees.  We  work  and  serve  hard  working 
immigrants in the lowest paying occupations in Miami-Dade County. These are men and 
women  who  work  extremely  hard  to  take  care of  their  families  here  and  in  Haiti  while 
holding  multiple  minimum  wage  jobs.   These  are  individuals,  many  of  whom  are  tax- 
paying  US  citizens,  making  unspeakable  sacrifices  to  reunite  their  families.  In  a  city 
where  the  cost  of  living  exceeds  the  average  wage,  the  proposed  fees,  some  as  high  as 
$905, represent for some, 75% of their monthly income.  The impact will be even more 
deleterious in elderly households where such fees will exceed monthly benefits earned by 
many elderly retirees, hoping to become US citizens.   

Again, let me express our strong opposition to the proposed fee hike which is arbitrary, 
unconscionable  and  tantamount  to  price  gouging  by  an  agency  with  complete  and  total 
monopoly over the process. It reinforces the strongly held belief in our community that 
our  work  ethic  and  our  reputation  as  hard  and  dependable  workers  will  never  be 
rewarded.  I  strongly  urge  the  USCIS  to  offer  user  fees  which  remain  reasonable, 
accessible  to  all  hard  working  immigrants  wishing  to  become  citizens  and  equitable  to 
US  citizens  wishing  to  be  reunited  with  family  members.   I  thank  you  for  your 
consideration in this matter.   

With Warm Regards,
