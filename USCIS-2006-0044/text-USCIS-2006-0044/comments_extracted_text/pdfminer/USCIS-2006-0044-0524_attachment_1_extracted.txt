I would like to make a comment on the proposed fee hikes and especially 
for forms: I-539 and I-765.  I understand the need for a fee hike with 
the rising costs of everything, but to make a 89% increase for form 
I-765 and a 50% increase for the I-539 is quite a hardship.  These 
students are also faced with double digit increases in tuition.  

You need to make the fee hikes more reasonable. 

Sincerely,
