Subject: Docket # USCIS - 2006 - 0044 

I am writing in regard to the possible increase in USCIS fees to ask you NOT to increase your fees to renew 
our I-171 (Petition to adopt an orphan).  We are currently in the process of adopting a child from China and 
our dossier is in China now as we wait for our referral.  The wait time for a referral  in China has been 
extended and our I-171 expires in July.  If we have not traveled by this time, we will be required to re-do 
our I-171 paperwork which will mean we will have to pay an additional $2000+ in fees to complete this all 
over again!  Please do not make this harder on Americans attempting to build their families through 
adoption.  If you raise the fees to re-do our paperwork, you will hurt thousands of American adoptive 
parents who are already overburdened at the thought of having to re-do our I-171 and refile.  Please do not 
complicate this by charging us an increased fee.  If you must increase your fees, please consider 
grandfathering us into the old rate so that we will not have this unnecessary burden placed on our heads.  
Republican Heather Wilson of New Mexico is currently attempting to pass a bill (Bill H.R. 628)  in 
Congress that will make our I-171's valid for 24 months.  Again, I ask that you please hear our request and 
not increase your fees. 
Thank you for your time!
