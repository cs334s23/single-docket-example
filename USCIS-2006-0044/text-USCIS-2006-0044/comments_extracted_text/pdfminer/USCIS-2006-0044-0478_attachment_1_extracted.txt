Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

We are writing to comment on the proposed new rule to raise the fees for the I-600 and N-600. 
We have adopted one child from Russia and are adopting another one soon, and the cost of 
these adoptions is exorbitant. Raising these fees will increase the burden families face in 
adopting and will likely contribute to fewer children being adopted, which would be a real tragedy. 
The percentage increase in these fees is also unusually large. We would suggest that rather than 
using a cost-based methodology, USCIS instead work aggressively to reduce its costs and use a 
fee methodology that is based on the unique circumstances faced by the types of individuals 
paying the fees. For example, adoptive families who are performing a "public good" and are 
already paying tens of thousands of dollars to adopt should be allowed to pay a much lower fee 
than adult immigrants who are seeking a new life in the U.S. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
