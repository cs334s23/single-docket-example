To whom it may concern: 

I understand that there is a planned fee increase for couples pursuing international 
adoption.  This is very disappointing as international adoption is already extremely 
expensive, and prevents many from being able to go through the process.  I hope that it is 
not too late for this fee increase to be reconsidered!  There must be another place to get 
the funds necessary for whatever shortage you are trying to fulfill!  Please know what an 
increased burden this will be for adoptive families.
