Dear Director, 

I am aware that USCIS is considering a substantial increase in the filing fees for I-129B 
(O-1 and P-1) visa petitions, and would like to request this increase be reconsidered. 

In my business I apply for such visas each year, and have been doing so for over 20 
years.  In my experience, the processing times have fluctuated widely, but in general have 
become longer in recent years.   

If the processing times could be assured of reaching the legislated period (I believe 30 
days?), then I would support the fee increase.  But if the processing times will continue to 
be much longer (sometimes 90 - 120 days), then I respectfully submit it is not appropriate 
to increase the fees. 

Sincerely, 
--David Rowe
