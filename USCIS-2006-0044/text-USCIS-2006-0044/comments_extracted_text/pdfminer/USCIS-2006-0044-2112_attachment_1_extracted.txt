USCIS Comments 

Dear USCIS Comments: 

I am writing in opposition of USCIS fee increases.  
The fees are doubling or tripling and are a burden to those affected.   We 
need to encourage more international students and scholars, not discourage 
them.   The United States reaps immeasurable benefits—for our foreign 
policy, our students' education, our economy, our competitiveness, and our 
public diplomacy—from attracting the best and brightest minds and the next 
generation of world leaders to America's educational institutions. 

While I understand that USCIS is permitted by law to recover the full cost 
of its services through fees, and indeed has no other option so long as 
Congress is unwilling to appropriate funds for the operation of the 
agency, I ask that the fees be reduced to the actual cost of processing 
the application or petition.  Meanwhile, I ask Congress to step up to its 
responsibility for fixing the untenable situation that drives these fee 
increases. 

Sincerely, 

Erin De Souza
