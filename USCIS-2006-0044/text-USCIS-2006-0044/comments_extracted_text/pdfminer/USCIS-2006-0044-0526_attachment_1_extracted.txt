Subject: Increase in fees for the I 600-A/ I 600 

With so many families now having to send through for processing twice, 
due to delays in the international adoption procedure, it seems that 
this is where a large percentage of the increased volume and thus 
processing costs are coming from.  As previously requested via our 
congressman, it seems the most efficient and economical thing to do is 
to increase the time that the form is valid.  Maybe from 18 months 
currently to 30 months.  This would eliminate having to have this 
processed twice, and reduce costs for USCIS and the adopting families 
who are already stretching their finances to bring their children home. 

Thank you,
