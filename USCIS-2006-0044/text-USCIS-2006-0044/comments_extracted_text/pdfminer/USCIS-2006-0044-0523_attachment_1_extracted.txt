Subject: [Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044];[FR Doc: E7-01631];[Page4887-4915]; 

I am writing as the International Student Advisor for our college. The 
proposed fee changes in the above mentioned Federal Register notice 
would in many cases prohibit international students and scholars from 
being able to apply. 

It is understandable that with the rising costs of all services fee 
adjustments need to be altered. However it should not be the 
responsibility of international students and scholars to pay for the 
changes, updating and rebuilding of USCIS services. This should be 
instead built into governmental funding, otherwise another barrier is 
placed in front of students and scholars to change status, remain in 
lawful status or take advantage of off-campus employment opportunities. 

Many other nations around the world are working at removing barriers 
for international students and scholars, with fewer processes and 
procedures to adhere to, therefore less costs incurred. The excessive 
increase of fees levied for the services listed in this notice are 
unreasonable and not reflective of the income of the customers using 
these forms.
