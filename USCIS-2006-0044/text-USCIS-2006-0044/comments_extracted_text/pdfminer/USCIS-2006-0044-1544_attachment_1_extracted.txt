My I360 was received by the USCIS office on March 31, 2006. On December 11, 
2006 I received a e-mail notification from your office stating your require more 
information. 

On December 27, 2006 I received another e-mail stating that you have mailed 
me a document based on the prior approval on my case.  This would refer to my 
I360 I assume. However, I never received this in the mail.   

I did notify your office on February 7, 2007 and was notified by your agent that a 
requested will be submitted to mail me a duplicate copy.  I was told that was all 
that was required. 

However, when I called again â€“ I was told that I had to submit an I824, with $200.  
This was told to me when I called the first time.  I was instructed to mail this to 
the Dallas Office, even though this case was send to your California. However, 
when I read your website it said that the I824 must be mailed to the office where 
the I360 was approved. 

So I called again to get the address of the California office. 

My lawyer felt that the e-mail of December 27, 2006 was an error because none 
of the I360 he submitted was approved.  On his requested,  more information 
was submitted to your office.  I received an e-mail from your office stating that I 
would receive a response from your office with 60 days, which will take us till the 
end of April, 2007. 

Because of the above reasons I feel strongly the increase of fees will not 
benefit me.   
Also, the mail of December 27, 2006 never reached me and I was given 
different instructions every time I called.  Because of this I still do not know 
where I stand with my I360.    
I feel that cases which was submitted in 2006 should not effected by the 
proposed fee increase 

Thank you,
