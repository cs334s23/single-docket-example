Dear Sir/Madam: 

1. I do not agree with raising the fees for citizenship, at all.  I am 
a U.S. born caucasian citizen, but I see no reason to raise fees to 
such a high amount like overnite.  A few dollars more would be one 
thing but to jump like you're proposing is ridiculous.  Is this a type 
of prejudice like let's let those of wealth become citizens and the 
others too bad? 
It sure looks like that.  I feel it's better to have people be full-
fledged citizens than in limbo or perhaps we don't want them to have 
voting rights?   

2. Also, I don't agree with the change in the testing as most Americans 
would have a very difficult time passing the one you've come up with or 
even the present one - let's face it!   

3. I have a hard time, while we're on it, understanding if only 
citizens can vote why we are required to have voter materials in 
different languages when the majority are supposed to be able to read 
and write English to become citizens.  That one makes no sense at all 
and is a waste of money. 

Thanks for your time and please, if you're not responsible for some of 
the above, pass on to whoever is. 

Sincerely, 

Linda Calderon
