Subject: USCIS-2006-0044- proposed fee increase 

I am writing this e-mail in regards to the proposed fee increase for the 
I-600A (application for advance processing of orphan petition). I am an 
adoptive parent-to-be currently waiting for a referral from China. Due 
to a slow down in dossier processing in China, I am forced to reapply 
for the I-600A as our fingerprints are due to expire in July and our 
I-171H is due to expire in November. It is bad enough that we are forced 
to reapply and pay all over again. (We feel that the extra time and money could be used 
towards caring for our daughter once she is home). An increase in fees would be a 
detriment to our family as well as many other families. Again, having to pay and reapply 
is another hoop to jump through. This fee increase exploits waiting families. In my home, 
with 3 of us needing to be fingerprinted, this proposed fee increase would be an 
additional, unforseen expense.
