To Whom It May Concern: 

As both an adoption professional and adoptive parent, I am writing to oppose the 
increase for the I 600 and I 600A  petition fees.  Fees were increased in the 
recent past - presumable to increase service and efficiency to the clients.  In my 
opinion, having worked in the field of adoption for 12 years, service and 
responsiveness remains a problem in may regional offices.    I would be 
interested in why a 66% increase in the fees is called for and specifically how 
those fees will improve service and where.
