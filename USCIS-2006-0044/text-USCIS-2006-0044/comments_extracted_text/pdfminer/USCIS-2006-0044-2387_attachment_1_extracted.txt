Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am writing to voice my opposition to raising any fees on the this document and/or fingerprinting. 
The fees on these documents and fingerprinting were already raised between 2006/20007. 
Please do not raise these fees, as they severely impact those families already paying hundreds of 
dollars in US govt. fees for adoption related endeavors.  

Thank you,  
Jennifer Tibbetts
