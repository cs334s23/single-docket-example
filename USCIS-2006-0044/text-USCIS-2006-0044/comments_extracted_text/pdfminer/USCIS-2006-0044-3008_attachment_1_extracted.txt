'1'0  Whom il. May Concern: 

On behalf of LA CASA IIEAI , I H  NETWORK, I write to strongly oppose thc 

incrcase to immigration t~nd naturalization fccs lli;~t t l ~ c  U.S. Citizenship and Immigmiion 
Scrvices (IJSCTS) proposcd on Fehruesy  1,2007.

Fcrllnwing our missiori we encourage and assisl new immigrunts to hecome US 

Citizens. In this regmd we pi-ovide frcc: English and civics classtis, assistance with 
completing the citizcnship application and prepmntior~ lirr the citizenship tcs~. 
Marly ol'thc immigrants and rclhgees wc work  wilh on a daily basis already shuggle LO 
pay immigration  l'ees.  The stccp irlcraases proposed by  IJS(?IS, whic,h in  some cilscs 
doublc ihc cumnl. Ite, would  put tlie goals of gaining permanent rcsidenl  status, reuniting 
wid1 lknlily members, and ullirrratrly becoming a U.S. ciiifm L~rthcr out of retlch. 
I JSCIS should be  building bridges for imrnigraiils to move toward citizcnship, not putting 
L I ~ )  walls. 

The proposcd  fcc for nabralizrttion is l-rerticularly jarring.  As rcccr~tly ils  1998, 
llle cost to apply for citizenship wes $95.  In 2002, after Presidcril. Rush took officc, lhe 
costs (illcluding bionrclric kcs) went up horn $250 10  $310.  The total ikrs arc now $400, 
a li)urlbld increase in thc pas1 eight ycars.  Now IUSCIS is proposing a further increase ol' 
70% ($675). An immigrant working at a niinimum-wage job would necd lo work lin- 
rrlcirc than  lhree weeks and save all of his carr~ings to pay lhis fee. 

Evcn more startling is the proposcd cosl of filing for ud.just.ment of status, which 

for muly immigrants is thc  lirsl step on the road lcading lo U.S. citizenship.  That 
application has risen  fro111 $130 in  1 YYX lo $325 today, plus $7.5  lirr hiometrics.  I Jndcr 
the proposcd rule, ~ h c  price will risc to $905, plus $80 h r  biometrics.  In  othcr words, it 
will cost nearly $1,000 for BII iimrnigran~. lo gct a green card ;ind start the five-yea 
countdown to citi~enship. A minimum-wagc iiiimigra~lt worker would ~lecd to si~ve a rull 
rnorrth's Fay  tu  a h r d  the proposed  fee. 

I~lul~igrutiou and citixnship arc public goods thal benctjt our cntire country and 
Illat  we as a nation should help pay for.  Immigrants bring their lirlcnt and hard work to 
our economy.  They pay  laxes and help revitalize our communities.  In  hecorning 
citizens, immigrants demonstrate their slrong conimitnient to their r~cw home coulltry hy 
lem~ling English, gaining knowlcdgc about Amctican Iiistory and gove~limcnt, and 
sweilsing allegia~lcc to the 1.Tnited States.  It is littlc wonder that newly nal~~rulizcd 
citizens, eager to participate  i n  nlir dcrr~ocracy, consistrntly votti aL  liighcr rates than othcr 
citizens.  Wc should bc ancouraging immigrults to bccomr  part of our community by 
gaining legal status and becoming citi~,cns, not sctting up harricrs that block their p ~ t h  
and kccp thctn out. 

I'or  all these reasons, the propusal to increase imniigratio~~ 

fccs is misguided and 

counterproductive,  Wc urgc USCIS to reconsider this proposal. and to seuk trlher so~u-ces 
of funding for its operations, rather thnn adil rnore b~rrdcns on immigran~s. 'rliallk you  li~r 
your co11side1-alion. 

Sinccrcly.
