Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044  

I am issuing my public comment on DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 - 
proposed Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit 
Application and Petition Fee Schedule.  I do not support this change as 
it places increased financial burden on families wishing to complete 
international adoptions, which are already extremely expensive.
