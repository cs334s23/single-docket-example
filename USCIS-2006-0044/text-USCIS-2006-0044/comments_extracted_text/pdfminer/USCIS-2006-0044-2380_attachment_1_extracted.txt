Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom it may concern, 
 Please do not update the fee for this form. Most people that uses this form is in  
 the process of adoption and incur enough fees as it as  to get their foreign child. 
 Please think about these people who are saving a child life. 
 Thanks, 
 Kimberly
