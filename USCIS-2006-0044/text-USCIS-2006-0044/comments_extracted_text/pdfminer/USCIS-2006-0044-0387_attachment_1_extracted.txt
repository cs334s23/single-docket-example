To Whom This May Concern; 

  I'm a Social Service Assistant for the Department of the Army and I use to work in 
Korea.  This is an area where a lot of Americans marry foreign nationals esp. Koreans, 
Philippinos and Russians.  I am also married to a Korean National, and she would like to 
someday become an American citizen.   

I think that the fee change will be ok BUT can I make a suggestion?   

How about giving our Soldiers of the Armed Forces and the civilians that work under 
the Department of Defense a break?  A lot of our Armed Forces and DOD civilians are 
living in areas where there are not a lot of other Americans.  So in other words maybe 
either giving them a discount on such fees like half off.  Or make less restrictions and/or 
less documents necessary for spouse's of foreign countries to become American citizens 
like their Soldier/DOD civilian spouses?  Our Soldiers and even some DOD civilians are 
in harms way every single day and this would be a way of showing our appreciation by 
allowing their spouses to become citizens without all the hassle/money needed to do this.  

Sincerely, 

Joe Missildine
