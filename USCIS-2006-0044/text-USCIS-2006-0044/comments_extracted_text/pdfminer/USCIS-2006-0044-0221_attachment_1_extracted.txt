I am immigration Attorney in San Antonio, Texas and via this e-mail would like to 
comment on your proposed filing fee increase. With respect to such fee increase,  the  
words that come to mind to describe your intention are  "outrageous" "exhorbitant", 
"extortion" and "reprehensible".  Your agency needs to find a way to be federally funded 
so that the intending immgrant does not have to "overly" pay for filing fees. I am apalled 
at your vicious attempt to increase your "bottom line". Perhaps Congress can earmark 
some of the monies that are to be sent to Iraq for the War to the issue at hand. God knows 
that the money would best  be spent on immigrants who intend to legalize themeselves 
than on a  War that the majority of the American Public did not want to engage in.
