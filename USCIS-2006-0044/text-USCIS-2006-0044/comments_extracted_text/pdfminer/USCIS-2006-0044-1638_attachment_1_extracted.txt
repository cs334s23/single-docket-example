Why should the fees be increased, If to my understanding congress is willing to offer 
financial assistance and help so there woudl be no need for this very hafty increase? I 
think that this increase has is all about hate! The person incharge of this area is definately 
anti-immigrant and  
thats why they refuse help from congress and want to put the burden on the people.  

I became a U.S. citizen on January 19th 2007 at one of the Cerimonies held at 
Montebello, CA. I can not tell you howe hard and deficult it was to come up with the 
$400.00 which is the current  
application fee. So now that they plan to double it, Its like Oh my GOD this people do not 
want us here. Thats the way I felt. Instead of you encouraging current legal residents to 
become more apart of this great nation, give them incentives or special assistance to 
become a full part of our country. You send them a very clear message. We don't want 
you here anymore. Have you all forgot that we all migrated here? Where is the In GOD 
we trust now? That is so anti-american. This is not what America ir being an American is 
about! I hope you reconsider and lower the cost instead.
