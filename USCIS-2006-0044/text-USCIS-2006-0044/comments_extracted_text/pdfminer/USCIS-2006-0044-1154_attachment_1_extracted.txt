To Whom It May Concern, 

Although I do not enjoy increases in costs (who does) I realize that it is a necessary evil. I will 
probably be effected by this increase, as my husband and I are adopting internationally. We will 
have to resubmit our I-600a form and have to pay the fee of $545 again and the increase of 
the additional $125 if this is passed due to increased wait times and the expiration of our original. 
Along with the international requirements changing, I only see this as another "filter", and that 
may not be a bad thing.  We are by no means rich, and this increase as I said will effect us 
however I am willing to pay it because not only do I understand that operating costs are 
expensive but I also will not be deterred from finding our child. 

My only recommendation would be to consider having resubmissions at a different rate. I do not 
know what the process consists of, it may be a new and separate paperwork process. And if so, 
then I understand why that wouldn't work. But if having to get our I-600a and I-600's redone 
because of countries wait times that are out of our control, it would be a nice break to have the 
renewal fee lessen from the $670 if at all possible.  

Again these are only my thoughts and concerns, I appreciate your time.
