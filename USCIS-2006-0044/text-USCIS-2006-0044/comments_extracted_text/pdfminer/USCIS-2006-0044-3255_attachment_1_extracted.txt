SANTA FE COUNTY 
Resolution No. 2007 - 

A RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE UNITED STATES C$TIZENSHIP 
AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES (USCIS) FEE INCREASE 

WHEREAS, our  nation's  and county oewcotncrs  are making valyable  contributions to 
the  social,  cultrual,  and  economic life  of  thc  United  States  of  America  and Santa  Fe 
County; and 

WHEREAS,  Santa  Fe  County  is  home  to  many  hardworking,  tax-paying,  legal 
permanent residents who att: eager to become Americans by pursuing the dream of 
United States citizenship; and 

WHEREAS,  on  January  31,  2007,  the  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration 
Services  (USCIS)  announced  a  proposal  that  would  raise  the  fees  for  starting  the 
naturalization process from $400 to $675, an increase of 69%; and 

WHEREAS, the USCIS anticipates that tho fee hike will go into effhct in June; and 

WHEREAS,  naturalization fees have  been  soaring since  1991, +en 
residents paid $90 to apply fi)r U.S.  citizenship; and 

legal  permanent 

WHEREAS, naturalization fee increases result from our nation's  fpdamentally flawed 
system  of  f m c i n g  immigration  services,  which  requires  the  UlCIS  to  rely  almost 
exclusively on application fees to fund the delivcry of services to imhigrants; and 

WHEREAS,  the  USCIS  believes  that  it needs  this  massive  fee  hike  to pay  for major 
infrastructure  investments  and  process  enhuncments,  such  as: improvcmcnts  in  the 
timelineas of background checks, modernization of its outdated busipess systems through 
technology upgrades, facilities improvements arid enhancements in  its personnel  training 
and recnlitment programs; and 

WHEREAS, the proposed  fee increase  would  place a  nearly insuqnountahle  harrier  in 
the path of legal permanent residents who seek to naturalize, many of whom have limited 
financial resources; and 

WHEREAS, we  believe that  our  system for  funding immigration $ervices should  bc a 
partnership  between  newcomers  and  the  federal  government  where  applicants  pay  a 
~ a s s n a b l e  fee for quality service; and

FEE INCHBASE 

WHEREAS, we believe that our  system for funding immigration Jservices should be  a 
partnership  between  newcomers  and  the  federal  governmcnt  w h w  applicants  pay  a 
reasonable fee for quality service; and 

WHERAS, the USCJS' proposed fee increlisc is contrary to thc spi$  oaf our nation's  and 
county's  tradition of  welcoming  and integrating immigrants, and shdz legal  permanent 
residents the wrong measage at a time when they arc seeking to embracc U.S. citizenship; 
and

newcomers become full participants in our nation's civic life; md 

to  ensure  that 

WHEREAS, the MI  participation of newcomers enriches and  maintains thc  vitality  of 
our democracy. 

I

all naturalization applications; 

We call on the Director of the USCIS to immediately provide President George W. Bush

appropriations that  would  bc  needed  to w b l e  the  USCIS  to modimize  its operations, 
and enhance its naturalization serviccs, without raising the naturnlizmkion fee; 

We call on President George W. Bush and the U.S. C o n p s s  to address the fundamental 
problems  in  our  nation's  system  for  financing  immigration  services  by  providing 
appropriations to supplemcnt fee rtvmue to cover costs of major USCIS expenses such
