Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

Dear Sir/Madam, 

It is my understanding that you will soon make a decision on the following fee increases as stated 
in Docket #USCIS-2006- 0044 - U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: 

*N-600 fee will go from $255 to $420  

*I-600A Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative fee will go from $545 to $670  

*N-565 Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship (used for name 
changes) will go from $220 to$380 
*Biometric Services (fingerprints) will go from $70 per person to $80 per person 

I ask that you consider the negative impact that this decision will undoubtedly have on the 
families who are seeking to provide loving homes for children.  I might suggest that you look to 
alternate possibilities to cover costs as opposed to the passing of higher fees to adoptive families 
who are already committing to a life time of support (which includes their significant financial 
responsibility) for these children. 

Thank you in advance for a decision not in favor of increasing these fees. 

Sincerely, 

Paul Black
