To Whom it May Concern: 

With regard to the recent suggestion to adjust of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule, I must strongly voice my opposition.  

My husband and I, like many other couples in the United States have a true calling and a 
heart for abandoned and orphaned children all over the world. In order to help allieviate 
this worldwide crisis in some small way, we decided to add to our family by adopting a 
baby.  

As you are already aware the fees for international adoption continue to increase. 
Families like ourselves and so many others will no longer be able to afford the 
astronomical costs of adopting if these fees continue to soar. We cannot change the 
policies in other countries; however, as an American citizen who has the freedom to 
voice my opinion, I plead with you to reconsider this major monetary increase. If not for 
adoptive parents who can't afford to pay any more money, then please do it for the orphan 
children all over the world who desperately need to find a home.  

Please seriously reconsider  the cost increase to file for an orphan petition (I-600A) and 
for biometric services. There has to be a better solution. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Natania Cook
