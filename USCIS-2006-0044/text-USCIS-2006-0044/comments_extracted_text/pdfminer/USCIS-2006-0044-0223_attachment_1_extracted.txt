Subject: Regarding DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 

To whom it may concern: 

Under the USCIS proposal (DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044) , the cost to file an N-400 
citizenship application will go from $400 to $675, a 70% increase. Other filing fees will 
rise even more sharply. Sponsoring a fianc√© to immigrate (form I-129F) will cost $455, 
up from $170. Filing an I-130 immigrant relative petition will cost $355, up from $190. 
The fee to file an I-485 application for a green card will soar from $325 to $905. And 
filing an N-600 application for a citizenship certificate for a child of a US citizen will 
cost $595, compared to the current $330. 

These fee increases will have a devastating impact on immigrant families, many of whom 
already struggle to gather the funds they need to pay for citizenship and other 
immigration applications. 

USCIS claims that it needs these increases to make up the costs of processing 
applications and fund improvements in service. Yet USCIS has refused to seek funding 
from Congress to help pay for these costs, even though community advocates have 
offered to help USCIS ask Congress for funding. 

I'm writing you today to register my strong opposition to these unnecessary fee hikes. Other 
funding from Congress needs to be sought. As a community advocate, I am willing to help in 
this endeavor. Thank you for taking my concerns into consideration.  

God bless you,
