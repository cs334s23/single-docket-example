Subject: docket number (USCIS-2006-0044) 

As i read the article of Building an Immigration Service for the  
Twenty-First Century, I realized all the information supplied as regards  
processing filed application tends to refer to U.S. Citizens only. My main  
concern is the I-130 Pertition for Alien Relative. The website states that  
the current proccessing period is 6 months and goes on to state that going  
forward with the increase in filling fees it will be shortened. I'm sure  
this was regards to only U.S.Citizens. 

How about permanent residents? right now it takes a very longtime, i have  
heard it takes about 5 years. Does the "whole new Twenty-First Century  
USCIS" NOT cater for permanent residence filling for relatives? 

Your faithfully 
William Wasula
