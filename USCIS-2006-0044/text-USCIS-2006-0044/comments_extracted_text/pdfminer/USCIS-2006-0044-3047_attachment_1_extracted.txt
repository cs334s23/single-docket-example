Subject: [Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing in regards to Docket No: USCIS-2006-0044, 
the proprosal to increase fees on international 
adoption.  I am an adoptive parent and am currently in 
the process of adopting our second child from China. 
We have endured a lengthy process that only continues 
to grow. 

Our fingerprinting for our current adoption expires in 
May 2007, while our I171-H expires in August.  This 
unfortunately has not allowed enough time for us to 
complete our adoption.  The process to adopt from 
China has grown from 7 months when we started the 
process in October 2005 to a current 17-18 months.  We 
are still several months from completing our adoption. 
 This is not a fault of our own, it is simply the way 
adoptions from China are currently.  

By raising fees, we are essentially being charged 
twice while only receiving one service.  This is a 
great hardship for the many of us who have gotten 
stuck in the system.  International adoption is very 
expensive and we've jumped through all the hoops that 
you've set for us without complaint.  This however is 
frustrating and wrong.  I have also lobbied to extend 
the expiration dates on these crucial forms, there 
musts be changes made.  There are millions of babies 
out there without families and by doing this you only 
keep them from families that much longer.
