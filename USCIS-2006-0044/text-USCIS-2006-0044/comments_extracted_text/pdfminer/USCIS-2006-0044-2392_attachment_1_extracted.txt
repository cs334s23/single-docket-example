Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am adamantly opposed to the proposed increase in fees associated with our adoption process.  
The process is expensive already, and does not need to be made more expensive by adding 
additional fees. 
We are currently in the process of an international adoption, and our opinion is "leave it alone"..
