It is good idea to adjust the fees in order to eliminate the backlog of I-130 applications. 
Please something must be done to help Green Card holders of IR-5 category to have their 
spouses and children follow them as soon as they settle in the US. My wife and children 
will be separated from me for over two to five years before their I-130 can go through. 
This is terrible! Please do something to amend the rule for IR-5 to have their immediate 
family members follow to join. Thank you for your humanitarian cause.
