My husband and I are in the process of adopting from China and have recently heard about the 
proposed fee increase for the I-600 and fingerprinting cost.  We are writing to ask you to please 
reconsider. 

We are both working adults and an adoption of any sort is a huge financial burden.  Please 
reconsider the fee increase.   

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
