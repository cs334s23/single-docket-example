Subject: Please Do Not Increase Service Fees USCIS-2006-0044 

In the past, fees increases like this one have been incremental. This sudden and drastic fee 
change is indicative of anti-immigrant sentiment in the halls of government; there is no financial 
necessity for these fee increases, yet constant financial necessity among immigrant workers who 
are applying for most of these applications. If this fee increase passes, the fees will go from too 
high, to impossibly high. Please reconsider hiking these fees. Please consider humane reforms 
for immigrants who work tirelessly in the current system that is very similar to indentured 
servitude.
