To Whom It May Concern, 

I would like to state that I am appalled by your intention of raising the immigration fees.  
The fees are already high for the communities trying to legalize their status.   

As I think about becoming a naturalized citizen of this country, and with my current 
involvement in AmeriCorps you can imagine that the overall fee of $400.00 dollars is 
already beyond my reach, if you increase the fees it will be a long time before I can 
summon the money for the application fee.  I'm just one situation on how this increase 
would be a negative effect.  There are thousands of families struggling in the United 
States already.  They are trying to survive by working minimum wage jobs, and barely 
being able to support their family.  With your increase it would make it impossible for 
many to submit applications. 

While the government is building a wall between the United States and Mexico, ironic 
how opposite of what our involvement was with the Berlin Wall, this money could be 
used for the purposes you state would be the government's benefit if these fees were 
increased.  Overall better management of the Office of Citizenship and Immigration 
Services, thus being a more effective and strategic battle against terrorism.   

Please do not raise the fees, as this will be a burden that many families and individuals 
will not be able to overcome and will only be a massive obstacle for families to legalize 
their status or simply renew it.  

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
