Dear OS Comments:

RE:  DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044 

Proposed rule â€” Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit 
Application and Petition Fee Schedule 

Arab American Legal Services is deeply concerned about the proposed USCIS 
fee increase referenced above. 

Arab American Legal Services (AALS) works to provide free immigration 
services to Arabs and other immigrants most affected by current 
anti-immigrant policies in San Francisco. 

As Arabs and Arab Americans we stand with Asian communities struggling 
against the fee hikes that will severely impact the lives of all 
immigrants, particularly the working class-- those contributing to the 
American economy as our low and moderate income laborers. 

The massive and abrupt fee increase proposed by USCIS will delay or 
prevent Arabs, Asians, Latinos, Africans, and other immigrants from 
becoming U.S. citizens, reuniting with their families, contributing their 
knowledge and skills to our economy, and settling into our society after 
having escaped persecution. 

Together with other immigrant communities in the United States, and their 
families and friends elsewhere waiting to join our communities here, AALS 
urges USCIS to halt the proposed fee increases.  USCIS must work with 
immigrants and immigrant rights advocates to ensure the most just, 
effective, and expedient process towards full legalization of all 
immigrants.
