USCIS Comments 

Dear USCIS Comments: 

I am writing to you as an international educator in opposition to the 
February 1, 2007, proposed rule â€œAdjustment of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule.â€(cid:31)  The 
proposed fee increases are so exorbitant they will act as a disincentive 
for international students and scholars to study and work in the United 
States.  USCIS must reconsider the role of appropriated funds to meet the 
administrative needs of the agency.  I ask that fees be reduced to the 
actual cost of processing the application or petition. 

I am particularly concerned with the proposed fee increase for form 1-765, 
which is used to apply for Optional Practical Training.  If the fee 
increase is approved many of the College's international students will not 
be able to afford to apply for permission to work in the US.  As most 
health care providers are required to work a certain number of hours 
before they can take their licensure exams, the fee increase will 
negatively impact these students' ability to become licensed practitioners 
in their chosen field.  Please note that the US desperately needs trained 
health care providers at this time. 

Apart from the direct impact of the excessive fees, they are contrary to 
clearly expressed U.S. policies. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. 

Sincerely, 

Catherine Rogerson
