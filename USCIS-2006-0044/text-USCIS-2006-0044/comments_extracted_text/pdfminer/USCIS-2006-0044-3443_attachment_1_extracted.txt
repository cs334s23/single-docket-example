Dear Dr. Gonzalez:

As Immigrants from India, we are writing to oppose  the proposed  increase of the naturalization
fee  as well as other immigration fees (DHS Docket # USCIS-2006-0044)  which will prevent
many legal immigrants from achieving the American Dream of U.S.  citizenship.

We understand that N400 application fee could increase  in 2007 to as much as $800, double the
current total cost of $400.  Even more startling is the proposed  cost of filing for adjustment of
status (getting a green card), which for many immigrants is the first step on the road leading to
US citizenship.  The cost to apply for a green card (including fingerprinting fees) has risen from
$130 in 1998 to $400 today.  Under the proposed rule, the price will rise to $985.  In other
words, it will cost nearly $1,000  for an immigrant to get a green card and start the countdown to
citizenship.  A minimum-wage immigrant worker would need to save a full month's pay to  afford
the proposed  fee. These fee increases  will make citizenship unattainable for many  lower-income,
less-educated immigrants—immigrants who can currently become citizens and who make
outstanding Americans.

You have publicly stated your position that U.S. citizenship is "priceless,"  and that immigrants
would be willing to pay whatever the cost. But our experience  is that many low-income
immigrants, particularly immigrant families with multiple members who are eligible to  naturalize,
already have great difficulty  paying for their applications,  and already put off applying until they
can afford the cost. The majority of our clients in King County are low-income  and, when it
comes to naturalization, already rely on services like the fee waiver in order to become citizens.
A further  major  increase will only further  put citizenship out of reach for thousands of
immigrants who would love to become Americans.

Our government should welcome these hardworking, patriotic immigrants who want to be part of
our nation. Democratic inclusion rather than systematic  exclusion should be the touchstone  of our
Democracy. We should not be erecting new barriers to keep these would-be new Americans out
of our community, especially through unaccountable administrative action. We strongly urge you
not to raise these further barriers,  and to instead keep the door to the American Dream open to
those who want to pursue it. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
