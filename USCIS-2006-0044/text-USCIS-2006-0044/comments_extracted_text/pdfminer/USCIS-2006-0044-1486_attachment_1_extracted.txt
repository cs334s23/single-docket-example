Subject: Please Do Not Increase Service Fees (Docket number - USCIS-2006-0044) 

To Whom It May Concern: 

Our agency is located in a large Hispanic community near the historic Fort Worth Stockyards.  I 
am very concerned about the sharp increase in fees as part of immigration reform.  Hispanics are 
hardworking people and very committed to their families and the community, but they are also 
very low income.  More than 92 percent of the children in the public schools in the Northside 
quality for free or reduced meals. 

The increased costs for green cards, work permits, etc. will be very burdensome for those who do 
so much of our cityâ€™s manual labor.   

I pray that those making the decisions might carefully consider the plight of the Hispanic workers 
and not place unreasonable penalties on those who only want their children and families to have 
a better life. 

Respectfully,
