Dear sir or madam, 

I am writing with concern about proposed fee hikes on immigration petitions.  The increase is a substantial 
burden to aliens.  $985 (including biometrics) to file for adjustment of status?  Even for a normal middle 
American family, that's a lot of money.  For an alien family making $22,000 it's a crippling fee.  This 
increase will unfortunately lead to more friviolous filings by unscrupolous notorios who have no problem 
preying on desperate aliens.  These sort of actions by the govt is sending a message to immigration 
communities that the government is not your friend.  This is hardly the message one should be sending to 
improve national security. 

Please rethink this action and remember that we are a nation of immigrants - it is in our best interest to help 
aliens assimilate to our culture, not to push them away. 

Respectfully, 

Ian Bratlie
