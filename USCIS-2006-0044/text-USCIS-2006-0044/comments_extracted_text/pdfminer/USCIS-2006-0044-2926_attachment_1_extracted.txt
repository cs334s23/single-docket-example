Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am writing to comment on the proposed fee increase for the above docket 
number.  I strongly discourage the increase of this fee schedule because the cost 
of international adoption is very expensive to start with, and with the increase in 
application fees, I fear that many will choose NOT to adopt because of the costs.  
There are so many children who need parents and so many good, caring people who 
deserve to be parents, and it isn’t fair to these orphan children to remain orphans 
because of a person’s inability to pay the increasing cost of application fees.  So, I 
ask that you please consider these children when making your decision to increase 
the fee schedule. 

Thank you for your consideration.
