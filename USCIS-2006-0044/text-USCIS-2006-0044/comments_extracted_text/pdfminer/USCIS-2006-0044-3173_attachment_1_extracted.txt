schedule adjustment] 

Regarding Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044: 
Would like to oppose the fee increase suggested by USCIS.  Although I understand the 
reasoning behind the proposed fee structure I did not see a recommendation that 
documents such as the I600/I600A and corresponding Biometric Services should be 
viable for 24 months instead of the current standard of 18 and 15 months respectively.  
Please consider that the leading country in International Adoptions, China, currently has 
wait times which exceed the current standard documents and that those already invested 
in the program are having to renew their fingerprints and I600/I600A.  Therefore each 
family is paying twice for these necessary documents.  Please reconsider and either 
increase the viability of the documents or keep the current fees in effect.  A 66 % increase 
in adoption fees is unconscionable.  Thank you for your consideration!
