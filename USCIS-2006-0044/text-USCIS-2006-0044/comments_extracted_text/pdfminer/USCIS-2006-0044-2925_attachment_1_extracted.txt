I am writing to protest the proposed increase in fees for the I600 A form for adoption.  
The process is lengthy and the expiration date already short and the fee is also already 
substantial.  At a minimum the expiration date should be lengthened,  I don't understand 
why the fee has to go up.   

Thank you for registering my protest over the proposed increase in fees.
