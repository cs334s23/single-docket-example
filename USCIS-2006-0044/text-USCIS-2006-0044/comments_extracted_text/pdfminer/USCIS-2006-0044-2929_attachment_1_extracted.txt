Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

We are presently pursuing an International Adoption and already have one child that was adopted 
domestically and would like to comment on the increase.  Adoption is so expensive.  It is a 
challenge financially for most families to begin with.   The fees increase would be hard for many 
who are adopting.  I think that other options should be looked into for paying for those seeking 
asylum etc.  There could be a way made for them to pay after they have a job or make an 
opportunity for those using the immigration services to donate or sponsor those immigrating.  I 
donâ€™t think the burden should be put on those who are already sacrificing and often taking out 
loans to pay for their adoptions. 

Thank you for your time, 
Tracie Perrin
