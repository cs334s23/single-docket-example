As a prospective adoptive parent who’s application has been in to China for over a year and who 
has committed a large outlay of funds for this process, It is my sincere hope that the fee’s you are 
suggesting should be increased  should only relate to newly logged applications. The cost of 
adoption is extremely costly already and when making a decision to  adopt a cost assessment is 
done and these unexpected increases may prevent family’s to complete the process. Children 
need homes and we need to encourage families to adopt. Every effort should be made to reduce 
the costs and red tape in this process. It is a traumatic process of waiting as it is, and thus 
financial pitfalls do nothing to help the situation. 

Thanks for hearing my thoughts.
