Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

 Dear Director, 

From today's news that USCIS is going to increase fees tramendiously,for 

nationazation fee N400 it will jump from $330 to $595 and for change of status 

N485 from 

$325 to $905,we are normally live on low income level,this kind of 

increase almost take half or even one month income,we are lawful 

resident in united States and have paid taxes in work,now we want to 

became a lawful citizen,our goverment should help us to do so,not by 

raising such high fee like a punishment,if USCIS has insufficient budget 

problem,I would think our congress or goverment should give more budget 

to USCIS to increase people and efficiency. 

my another suggestion is to charge less to those low income senior 

people who wants to become citizen. 

thanks for your kind consideration, 

Regards, 

K Y Juan
