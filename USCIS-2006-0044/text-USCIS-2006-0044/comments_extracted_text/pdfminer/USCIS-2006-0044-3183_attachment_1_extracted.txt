Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To Whom It May Concern: 

Please do not change the fees for adoptions.  The cost for this is already out of reach when all 
people want to do is to help others and to have a family.  Many of these couples are working  and 
trying so hard to have children.  Please keep the fees the same. 

Thank you, 
Cheryl Beaty
