Dear USCIS,  

I, Anuradha Prashantini, am deeply concerned with the proposed increase in the 
application fee for U.S. citizenship and other immigration benefits.    

I believe that USCIS should find a solution that promotes, rather than discourages, 
immigrant integration.  I believe the fee increase would discourage low-income legal 
immigrants from pursuing permanent resident status and citizenship.  This is clearly a 
strike against integration efforts.  Encouraging integration is in national interest because 
it strengthens national security.  Inviting and involving immigrants in our society's public 
institutions is good for our nation.   

The United States is a nation that is strengthened by the contributions of newcomers of 
all backgrounds.  Raising the obstacles to integration goes against this legacy.  

Finally, I believe the cost of processing immigration and naturalization benefit 
applications and petitions should NOT be on the backs of prospective immigrants. I 
believe Congress should appropriate money for technology and infrastructure 
improvements at USCIS.   

Sincerely,  

Anuradha Prashantini
