Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

I find it very disappointing that yet another fee is being increased.  
As someone that is in the process of adopting internationally this is 
of great concern to me.  Please consider NOT increasing the fees 
associated with this Docket No.  Thank you.  Alisa S.
