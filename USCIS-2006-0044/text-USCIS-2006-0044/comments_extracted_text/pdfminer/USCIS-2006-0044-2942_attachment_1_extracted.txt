I am commenting regarding the above.  The fee increases proposed by this 
regulation will be a hardship to thousands of people trying desperately to 
adopt internationally.  There are so many fees and costs to incur during 
this long process that many cannot even begin to be able to afford to adopt 
a child that desperately needs a home and a loving family.  The fee 
increase is a MAJOR increase that indeed would be a hardship.  This along 
with the fact that the forms are only good for 18 months from date of issue 
and the fingerprints for only 15 monthsâ€”most will have to pay these fees 
twice for the same adoption as the adoption will not finalize before the time 
limits are up.      
It is my sincere opinion and objection to these fee increases that I strongly 
encourage to be taken into consideration.
