Increased fees 

J 

These proposed increases amount to a draconian measure that will keep many resident from 
applying for citizenship and will further tarnish the reputation of the US Citizenship and 
Immigration Service who's quality of service has in no way  increased commensurate to the 
increase in fees it has carried out during the past increases. 

If USCIS does not want to appear to be using these fees to keep people from becoming citizens 
it should first improve the quality of service and only then moderately increase the fees by a 
reasonable percentage.
