Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

To whom it may concern:  

I'm writing to request that you do not increase the fees for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
services.  My husband and I are currently in the process of adopting a child from China.  We have 
already paid the fees for fingerprinting and the I-600A form, but because of the increased wait 
time to receive a referral from the Chinese Center for Adoption Affairs, all of our paperwork will 
expire and the fees will have to be paid again.  Currently, families adopting from China are 
waiting 18 months to receive their referrals and another one to two months before they receive 
their travel approval.  Our adoption agency notified us that we will most likely be waiting 24 
months for a referral.  Since fingerprinting is only valid for 15 months, and the I-717H for 18 
months, all families currently waiting for their children from China and other countries with similar 
situations, will have to pay the fees twice.   Please do not increase these fees. 

Thank you,  
Amy Morehouse
