Subject: USCIS-2006-0044 

This email is in regard to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services request to increase fees 
for international adoption.  The docket number is USCIS-2006-0044.  

We are in the waiting process for our daughter from China.  In the next couple of weeks, we will 
begin AGAIN to process our USCIS paperwork.  We will need to get re-fingerprinted and re-apply 
for I-171H form.  We have already spent $685 with the US government to go through this process 
once.  Now we must go through it again and spending a total of $1,370.  If your fees go up, we 
will spend $830 on our SECOND go around.  That would have us pending a total of $1,515.  
International adoption is not an inexpensive endeavor. It is emotional and monetarily taxing.  Your 
fee increases are huge (12.5% for fingerprinting and 18.6% for I-600A) Please reconsider your 
fee increases.  Most families have to go through this process twice with USCIS now due to the 
longer waits for most countries to adopt.  So you already are getting a double hit from the vast 
majority of adopting parents, we find it unconscionable that you would increase fees on top of 
that. 

Sincerely,
