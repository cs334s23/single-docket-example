Subject: DHS Docket No. USCIS-2006-0044 

As a practitioner who can remember when I-130s cost $10, I-485s $30, and N-400s $15, 
it is astonishing to see the rate increases that your agency has proposed.  With the 
biometrics fee, an I-485 would cost $975 and N-400 $615 (assuming that biometrics will 
still cost $70).  The burden is crushing on many would be applicants who do not make as 
much as the average American.  The rationale for such astronomical fee increases is 
chiefly for the agency to pay for its own services as it upgrades its infrastructure.  I 
believe that the U.S.C.I.S. should scale back its ambitious plans to make the agency into a 
technological marvel.  U.S.C.I.S. states that by law its collection of fees must pay for its 
operations and that is obviously true at present, but one does not see the city of New York 
or any other municipality attempting to fund new bridges or city buildings when in a 
fiscal crunch.  At such time, municipalities know that it is time to strap their belts a little 
tighter.  Such should be the philosophy of  U.S.C.I.S..  Minimum and not maximum fee 
increases should be the order of the day.  There is already a huge outcry against this fee 
increase which has resulted Senate Bill 795 and its House counterpart, H.R. 1379, which 
will change U.S.C.I.S. from a totally fee based organization to one once again only 
partially dependent upon collection of fees by authorizing annual appropriations to the 
Department of Homeland Security for an amount equal to the difference between the fees 
collected by U.S.C.I.S. and the cost of providing the services.  U.S.C.I.S. would then be 
allowed to set fees to ensure the recovery of either the full cost or a portion of the costs of 
providing the services for.  U.S.C.I.S. should be more sensitive to the financial situation 
of the immigrant population which provides such an integral boost to the nation's 
economy through its work, and ask for only minimal fee increases while Congress 
deliberates its funding bill for the agency.
