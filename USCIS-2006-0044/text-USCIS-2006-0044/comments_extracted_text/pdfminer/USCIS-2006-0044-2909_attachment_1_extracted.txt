Benefit application fee schedule adjustment 

I am writing to voice opposition to the proposed increases in USCIS  
fees for adoption.  I am a United States citizen currently in the  
process of adopting a child from another country.  My husband and I  
have been saving for years so we can start a family in this way. The  
current costs of adoption, whether domestic or international, run  
generally $20,000-$30,000 per child. This is a great financial burden  
for families like ours who cannot biologically bear children of our  
own.  Any fee increases will further burden an already costly  
process, and will make adoption prohibitively expensive for many  
families.  Please reconsider these fee increases.
