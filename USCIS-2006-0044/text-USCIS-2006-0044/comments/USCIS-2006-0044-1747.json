Adoption is such an <br/>expensive process and for most families, like us, that money is usually not <br/>something that is just sitting around waiting to be used. It is hard earned and <br/>carefully allotted for each step along the way. Up to this point, filing with US CIS <br/>was one of the most expensive, and timely, steps we had to go through which was <br/>somewhat disappointing. In addition to this, families like ours who choose to adopt <br/>from China are being forced to file with US CIS a second time because the 18 <br/>month expiration period is not long enough to fulfill the current referral time frames. <br/>It&#39;s one thing to file once, but to pay that amount of money plus what is now being <br/>proposed in addition to the standard fee a second time is outrageous. That extra <br/>money needs to be used for necessities such as cribs, car seats, high chairs and <br/>other items to care for a child. In my opinion, it is not a necessity to charge extra <br/>for an already expensive process.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a018", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:20:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:02:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Denis N.
