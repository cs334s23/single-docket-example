Fee increases are fine if that is <br/>what is needed to process and complete documents in a more timely and cost <br/>effective manner.  However, as US citizens currently in the process of an <br/>international adoption we are disappointed to see this proposal.  International <br/>adoption is a very expensive endeavor in and of itself.  What disappoints us most <br/>is the fact that many adoptive families must redo fingerprints and re-apply for other <br/>forms/documents (ex. I-171) because they expire at 15 and 18 months.  If this fee <br/>increase is absolutely necessary, would it at least be possible to extend the <br/>times that the current forms are valid so that families would not have to pay these <br/>fees multiple times?  If not,we ask that you take more time to consider this <br/>increase and how it will not only affect adoptive families, but also immigrants and <br/>others utilizing your services.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de57", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T20:55:58Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lappe Family", "trackingNbr": "8021de57", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2581/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2581/attachments"}}}}}
