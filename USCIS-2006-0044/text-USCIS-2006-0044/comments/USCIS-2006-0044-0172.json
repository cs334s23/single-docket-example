A better alternative, <br/>suggested by the New York Times, is to change the funding structure for this <br/>agency so that tax dollars can supplement the funding of this agency in addition to <br/>fees collected.<br/><br/>I hope this is really an attempt to improve customer service, which I agree is <br/>horrible and needs improvement.  Maybe you should outsource the paperwork to <br/>Indian IT firms, which currently set the standard for responsiveness and attention <br/>to detail in transactional work.  I&#39;ve called Nebraska SC and I&#39;ve called my <br/>company&#39;s help desk in Bangalore, and I much prefer to talk to Bangalore.<br/><br/>I am afraid however that the customer service argument is a ruse, and that the <br/>agency is really trying to reduce its workload and discourage applicants by pricing <br/>their services out of the purchasing range of prospective legal immigrants.  This <br/>escalates the &quot;pre-emptive poll tax&quot; fee structure that makes avoiding legal status <br/>such an attractive (or downright necessary) option to low-income immigrants. <br/><br/>Recent political developments have clearly shown that USCIS lacks the mandate <br/>for unilateral action against poor immigrant families and should not take action <br/>until comprehensive reform to ease immigration requirements have been passed <br/>by the new Congress.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa5f2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T16:43:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-05T15:48:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By A.D.F.", "trackingNbr": "801fa5f2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0172/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0172/attachments"}}}}}
