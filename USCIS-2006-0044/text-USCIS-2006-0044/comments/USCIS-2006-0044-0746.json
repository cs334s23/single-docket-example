I informed them that I was not a citizen of this country therefore <br/>could not vote. The next question that came out of their mouth was always the <br/>same. Why don&#39;t you become a citizen? I was always had to tell them, I could not <br/>afford it. At the time, I believe the fee was approx. $300. With $300 I could buy a <br/>textbook, maybe two if I was lucky. Becoming a citizen was not a fiancial priority. <br/>When I finally graduated, the naturalization process moved to the top of my list. It <br/>still took me over 18 months after my graduation to save up the $450 dollars <br/>needed for the application fee, not to mention the $70 fingerprinting fee. When you <br/>have a college degree and are only making $11 dollars per hour, $520 dollars is a <br/>lot of money. So I know you will be suprised to know that I support the decision to <br/>increase the fees. <br/><br/>I feel that those who truly have a desire to become legal residents or citizens of <br/>this country will pay any price necessary. That includes fees, lawyers, fines, <br/>whatever the amount. These people left their home country in order to make their <br/>lives as well as their families lives better. One way to make it better is to become <br/>legal residents or citizens of this country. If you ever pick up newspapers <br/>dedicated to the immigrant communities in this country, you will see that these <br/>immigrants are always looking for news from the USCIS. Although they may <br/>initially complain, all will do anything possible even if it means saving for months <br/>like I did. <br/><br/>Also, I wanted to address the issue if you bring back laws such as 245i, that will <br/>also add income to the USCIS. Think about how many people would benefit under <br/>the reimplementation of such laws as 245i, that at the moment are not paying any <br/>fees towards the USCIS. These people are waiting for a bill to pass or laws to be <br/>made that would benefit them. They are awaiting the opportunity to pay USCIS <br/>money in order to make their lives better. Not only increase the fees, but increase <br/>the opportunities for people to pay those fees.<br/><br/>I finally voted last November. I hope it was worth the $520 I paid for that &quot;right&quot;. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020962b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:48:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-20T03:28:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Izabelle Gomes", "trackingNbr": "8020962b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0746/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0746/attachments"}}}}}
