As someone attempting to<br/>adopt a child (an orphan) from China, we are already paying an outrageous amount<br/>of money to do this. furthermore, as fingerprints are only &quot;good&quot; for 18 months,<br/>and wait times are extending beyond 20 months (or more), we&#39;ll have to pay these<br/>fees twice, sometimes tree times!! We can not afford it.We are trying to grow<br/>our family in the only way we can, and we are not made of money. To increase<br/>these fees may mean we are unable to continue with our dreams. At the VERY<br/>LEAST, our I-171H should be extended and we should be &quot;grandfathered in&quot;: so<br/>those of us who have already paid these fees once won&#39;t have to pay again.  Let<br/>people who are applying now (for the first time) pay more, but don&#39;t make those<br/>of us who have already PAID have to pay more than TWICE what we paid!! What a<br/>terrible hardship this is for families.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c618", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:57:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T00:58:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Danesha Carley", "trackingNbr": "8021c618", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2253/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2253/attachments"}}}}}
