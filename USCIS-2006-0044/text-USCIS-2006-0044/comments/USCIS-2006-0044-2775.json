I understand the need to increase fees from time to <br/>time, but a 66% increase is not appropriate.  Why penalize people that are willing <br/>to spend a fortune to give a needing child a real home?  Increasing more fees that <br/>affect adoptions only inhibits more children from finding a home, and leave them <br/>with few options in life.<br/><br/>I urge you to reconsider this fee.<br/><br/>Sincerely - <br/>Keith Loppnow<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ed9a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T16:18:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Keith Loppnow", "trackingNbr": "8021ed9a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2775/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2775/attachments"}}}}}
