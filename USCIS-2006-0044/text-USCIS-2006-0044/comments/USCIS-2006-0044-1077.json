I have seen, <br/>over a decade, the fee for naturalization rise from less than $100 to the present <br/>$330. The proposed increase to $595 makes the process even more expensive <br/>and places naturalization further out of reach for many permanent residents. While <br/>the process is smoother than it was in the 1990s, the numbers are also much <br/>reduced, and I don&#39;t understand why the USCIS needs to continue increasing fees <br/>so drastically. A large number of immigrants in Los Angeles have been permanent <br/>residents for many years but have never pursued naturalization. The proposed fee <br/>increase discourages, instead of encourages, them to pursue naturalization, which <br/>I would think is the opposite of what the USCIS should be doing.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020dc98", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-05T21:05:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-05T18:37:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Gregory A.
