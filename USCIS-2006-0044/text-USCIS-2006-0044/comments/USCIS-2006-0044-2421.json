If this is not financially <br/>acceptable, then I suggest the timelines extend to the completion of the applied <br/>for adoption. <br/><br/>Currently the biometric results are good for 12 months and the I-600/600A is good <br/>for 18 months. International timelines are such that parents are having to submit <br/>these fees twice for a single adoption. <br/><br/>Our family submitted fees twice for our first adoption and will do so again for our <br/>third adoption. Duplication of services at such high costs serves no purpose and <br/>puts an undue financial burden on the families. It puts an additional burden on <br/>USCIS to replicate the services they have already provided.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this point of view.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cfbd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:52:01Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T19:25:50Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Susana Rivera", "trackingNbr": "8021cfbd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2421/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2421/attachments"}}}}}
