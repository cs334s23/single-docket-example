It really is a raising of the fees <br/>which will effect many people who are in the process of adopting and desiring to <br/>provide a home to the world&#39;s orphans.  Raising these fees will place additional <br/>financial burden on those who are trying to make this world a better place.<br/><br/>I, myself am single and waiting for a referral from China.  I am a teacher and have <br/>made many financial sacrifices to pay for this adoption.  I have taken on additional <br/>responsibilities at school and a second job in order to cover the expenses of this <br/>adoption and to be financially prepared to provide for my daughter. When she <br/>comes I will be debt free and will be able to just have one job.<br/><br/>Raising these fees will add financial stress on top of the stress of increased <br/>waiting times for referrals.  We have no control over the wait time and might have <br/>to refile our I-600 and be fingerprinted again, so having to repay an increased fee is <br/>not fair for those of us who are already struggling financially and emotionally to <br/>adopt and have a family and provide a family.<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to comment on this matter.<br/>Lara Himmel<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802160a8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-19T16:25:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-19T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-19T13:55:42Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Lara Himmel", "trackingNbr": "802160a8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1305/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1305/attachments"}}}}}
