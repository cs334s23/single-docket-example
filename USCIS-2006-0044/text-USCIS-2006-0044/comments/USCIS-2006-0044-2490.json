Increasing the burden on us is not simply unfair.  We urge rejection <br/>of the current proposal and a new requirement that USCIS reduce the fee burden <br/>on adoptive families, give first priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate the <br/>paperwork required for orphan petitions, and extend the expiration <br/>of the I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>V Anders<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d9de", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:17:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T06:36:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by V Anders", "trackingNbr": "8021d9de", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2490/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2490/attachments"}}}}}
