This process is extremely<br/>expensive, not the least because of forms like the I600-A, which cost several<br/>hundred dollars.  And now, because of increased waiting times for the adoption<br/>process, the form will expire before we will even be able to use it to adopt our<br/>child!  It is unfair enough for us to have to refile in order to do what we<br/>filed for in the first place; raising the fees is unconscionable.  The form<br/>should have a longer time frame; and the fees should be kept where they are, or<br/>better yet, waived for those who have to now reapply.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ad6d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:27:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T05:08:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Bonnie S.
