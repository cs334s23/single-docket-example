I wouldn&#39;t <br/>mind increasing fees, if it was to hire more people to help expedite the process of <br/>being able to bring your child home faster, or to make a love one a US Citizen a <br/>little less stressful.  My husband and I have been in the process of adopting for 16 <br/>months and have paid our fee for the I-600A and do not feel it is fair for us to have <br/>to pay more money because the adoption process has taken longer than <br/>necessary.  Raising fees to this degree, will only make it harder for families to <br/>complete the necessary paper work for their love ones.
