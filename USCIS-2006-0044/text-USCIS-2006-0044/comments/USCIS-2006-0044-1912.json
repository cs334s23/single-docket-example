We have not only had to pay these fees once, but now <br/>twice due to the increased wait time that we have experienced.  I understand that <br/>the increase in wait time is not due to our government or your agency, but the fact <br/>of the matter is that it continues to increase.  We have had to have our home <br/>study updated, our fingerprints re-taken and to file an additional I-600A, which have <br/>each increased our costs significantly.  An additional increase in processing fees <br/>would cause a major hardship on hardworking families who simply want to expand <br/>their families and provide a home to an orphan.  Please take my comments along <br/>with the others which you have received and reconsider the increases in fees that <br/>have been proposed.  I thank you for your time and consideration.  <br/><br/>Respectfully, <br/>Nikki L.
