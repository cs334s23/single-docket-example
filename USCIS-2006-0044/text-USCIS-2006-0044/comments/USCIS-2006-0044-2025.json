We have already paid the fee for the application of the I 600A <br/>and fingerprinting. The wait for a child has increased and is expected to become longer. Therefore <br/>we will have to refile, which is an added expense to an already very expensive process.<br/>I do not believe that couples who are trying to adopt a child should have to pay to refile. For the fee <br/>to increase for those of us who have already paid once is absolutely horrible, adding to the financial <br/>and emotional stress of a long, hard adoptive journey.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Paula Hall<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b6dd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:18:19Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T20:53:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Paula P.
