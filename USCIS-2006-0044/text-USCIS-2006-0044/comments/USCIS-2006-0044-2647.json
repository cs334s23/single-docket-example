You will hear many reasons why this proposed increase is<br/>unfair, most notably that fees are already unconscionably high especially given<br/>the often long waits and sometimes poor service received, and especially given<br/>the fact that prospective adoptive parents often must pay these fees twice or<br/>even three times, when delays cause documents to expire and require refiling and<br/>new filing fees.<br/><br/>All I wanted to add, as a psychologist, is that your handling of these issues<br/>provides you with an opportunity to &quot;win friends and influence people&quot; at a time<br/>when we are especially open to the support or lack thereof in fulfilling a<br/>dream, to become parents of children desperately in need of families.  A warm<br/>welcome at the embassy when we are far from home and frightened that &quot;something<br/>could go wrong&quot; at a last hurdle, is something we can remember for a lifetime as<br/>our own government being &quot;there for us&quot; when it counted. Similarly, we may<br/>remember the uncaring official, the unnecessary delay processing the initial<br/>paperwork to start the I600A, and the sense that we are being &quot;soaked&quot; for high<br/>fees under the mistaken assumption that if we have managed to afford to adopt<br/>overseas, we must be wealthy families who will never miss a hundred dollars here<br/>and a few hundred more there.  Even more painful is the perhaps-paranoid,<br/>perhaps realistic sense that we may be being punished for adopting overseas<br/>instead of domestically, when we may well have been discriminated against and<br/>denied by domestic agencies for years before opting to look internationally for<br/>our kids.<br/><br/>Most native-born Americans never deal directly with USCIS and never have an<br/>opportunity to form a personal opinion about your agency.  Treating us fairly<br/>and with sensitivity can go a long way to win our support for you as an agency,<br/>or &quot;leave a bad taste&quot; forever ...<br/><br/>Thanks for considering this!   <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e392", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:35:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T15:29:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Private Citizen", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Elissa Schroeder", "trackingNbr": "8021e392", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2647/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2647/attachments"}}}}}
