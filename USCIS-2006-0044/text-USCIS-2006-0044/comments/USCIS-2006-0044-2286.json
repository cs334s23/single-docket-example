Today the exact <br/>same<br/>form costs a prospective adoptive parent $545.  Biometric <br/>fingerprinting,<br/>which began in 1998, has risen in cost from $25 to $70 per applicant.  <br/>For a<br/>two-parent family adopting a single child, the USCIS process costs an <br/>upward<br/>of $685.   Because of the instability concurrent with international<br/>adoption, many families find that their USCIS approval expires prior to<br/>their invitation to travel to their prospective child?s birth <br/>country.  As a<br/>result, many families (especially those adopting from China and <br/>Guatemala)<br/>find themselves repeating the entire immigration application two or <br/>three<br/>times.  This can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of <br/>dollars ?<br/>money many of us simply do not have. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are <br/>met<br/>with deaf ears and directed to a ?status? website which is not <br/>updated.  As<br/>a result of USCIS? refusal to prioritize orphan petitions, thousands <br/>of<br/>children suffer needlessly.  There has been no move by USCIS to assist<br/>prospective adoptive parents whose documents ?expire? while they <br/>wait for<br/>their child?s home country to grant them approval to travel.  These <br/>parents<br/>are forced to reapply with USCIS, repaying the same exorbitant fees two <br/>and<br/>sometimes three additional times, each time subjecting themselves to <br/>the<br/>same long and uncertain wait for immigration approval.  If USCIS would<br/>simply extend the ?expiration? deadline for the I-171H from <br/>eighteen months<br/>to three years, it would significantly reduce its workload without <br/>having to<br/>increase its fees.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for what <br/>it<br/>needs, it is asking for what it wants.  It claims that this fee <br/>increase ?is<br/>designed to provide for an adequate and sustainable level of investment <br/>in<br/>staff, in infrastructure, and processes designed to improve the <br/>USCIS?<br/>ability to administer the nation?s immigration laws.?  The Bureau <br/>justifies<br/>these increases by asserting that ?this fee rule would provide the <br/>necessary<br/>resources to maintain these processing time standards and fund further<br/>improvements to USCIS business operations to continue to reduce <br/>processing<br/>times while ensuring the appropriate level of security.?<br/><br/> <br/><br/> The idea that adoptive parents are a threat to national security is laughable.  <br/>While we agree  with the aims of the Department of Homeland Security, the <br/>additional levels of scrutiny on orphaned children and their prospective parents is <br/>absurd.  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud,<br/>improving service, changing benefit applications from paper to <br/>electronic<br/>means in order to streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to <br/>bear<br/>the burden of these goals is unconscionable.  Worse still, many of <br/>USCIS?<br/>stated aims do not directly benefit those seeking to immigrate.  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, <br/>and are mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings to bring <br/>home a child.  Increasing the burden on us is not simply unfair, it is <br/>detrimental to the lives of waiting children.  We urge rejection of the current <br/>proposal and a new requirement that USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive <br/>families, give first priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate the <br/>paperwork required for orphan petitions, and extend the ?expiration? of the <br/>I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerly, <br/>Concerned US Citizen <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ccc8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:02:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T15:00:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021ccc8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2286/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2286/attachments"}}}}}
