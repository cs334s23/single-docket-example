The <br/>proposed fees are so exorbitant as to be prohibitive to many who qualify for <br/>benefits.    Charging more than $900 for an adjustment package is simply <br/>unreasonable.  Historically, the EAD and travel documents have had their own <br/>fees and have been optional.  A 16 year old who is in school would still have to <br/>pay $900 for an application, but would not necessarily need the EAD or travel <br/>document.  Immigration documents should not be available only to the very <br/>wealthy.  These high prices could lead to families having to decide to apply one by <br/>one instead of all together. It is my understanding that the ultimate goal of U.S. <br/>immigration policy is family unification.  These prices are in direct opposition to <br/>that goal.   <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206461", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-15T23:52:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T18:10:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment SUbmitted By Jessica C.
