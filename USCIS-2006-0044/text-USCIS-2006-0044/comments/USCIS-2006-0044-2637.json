For a family adopting a single child, the <br/>USCIS process costs an upward of $685.   Because of the instability concurrent <br/>with international adoption, many families find that their USCIS approval expires <br/>prior to their invitation to travel to their prospective childs birth country.  As a <br/>result, many families  find themselves repeating the entire immigration application <br/>two or three times.  This can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of <br/>dollars, money many of us simply do not have.  There has been no move by <br/>USCIS to assist prospective adoptive parents whose documents expire while they <br/>wait for their childs home country to grant them approval to travel.  These parents <br/>are forced to reapply with USCIS, repaying the same exorbitant fees two and <br/>sometimes three additional times, each time subjecting themselves to the same <br/>long and uncertain wait for immigration approval.  If USCIS would simply extend <br/>the expiration deadline for the I-171H from eighteen months to three years, it <br/>would significantly reduce its workload without having to increase its fees.  Many <br/>adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and are <br/>mortgaging homes and cleaning out life savings to bring home a child.  Increasing <br/>the burden on a family is not simply unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of waiting <br/>children.  We urge rejection of the current proposal and a new requirement that <br/>USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first priority to I-600/600A <br/>applications, consolidate the paperwork required for orphan petitions, and extend <br/>the expiration of the I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e2fd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:53:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T13:28:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa Flaherty", "trackingNbr": "8021e2fd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2637/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2637/attachments"}}}}}
