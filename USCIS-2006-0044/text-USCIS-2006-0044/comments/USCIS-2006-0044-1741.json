For many of those choosing to adopt, the <br/>financial struggle is already upon us.  Don&#39;t raise these fees so that the end result <br/>may be fewer childen adopted.   <br/><br/>I feel that the only form of action I have is to voice my opinion, and therefore, I am <br/>doing so.   Please reconsider the proposal to increase fees for USCIS related <br/>petitions. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219fef", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:20:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T22:36:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Allison M.
