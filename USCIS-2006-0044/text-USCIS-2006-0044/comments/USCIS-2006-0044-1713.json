The people<br/>that will be adversely affected by these changes are those who most desperately<br/>need our help and the opportunities that being a US citizen affords:  orphaned<br/>children around the world.  The families that would be affected by these changes<br/>already face an enormous burden of paying for adoption and adding to their<br/>families, and to increase the burden strikes me as patently unfair to all involved.<br/><br/>I understand that costs rise over time, but a 66% increase affecting adoption<br/>alone and not other areas of immigration and naturalization seems extreme and as<br/>though someone is merely interested in making it harder for young,<br/>underprivileged children to find loving American families and experience the<br/>amazing opportunities that becoming an American gives them.  <br/><br/>Please do not institute this fee increase and thereby penalize families who are<br/>opening their arms and hearts to those who have less than nothing.  As an<br/>adoptive parent, I can tell you that this would hurt us as a family more than<br/>you might expect and truly limit how we can continue to build our family in the<br/>future.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mrs. Suzanne Talbert<br/>Dexter, MI.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219f26", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:53:23Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T21:05:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "self", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Suzanne Talbert", "trackingNbr": "80219f26", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1713/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1713/attachments"}}}}}
