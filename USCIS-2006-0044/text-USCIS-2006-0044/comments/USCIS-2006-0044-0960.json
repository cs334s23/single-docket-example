US government should <br/>appreicate the efforts and show the respect to those had high perspective of US <br/>goverment. By increasing the application fee at a rediculous amount is a sign of <br/>irrespection of immigrants and a distort of way of increasing revenue. <br/><br/>I am totally against such increment as over 50% of orignial amount which is not <br/>accetable. The attorney fee is skyrocking along with the increasing demand of <br/>immigration petition. Please allow those who are struglling to merge into main <br/>stream to have a decent life by not increase absurd amount of money for <br/>application fee.
