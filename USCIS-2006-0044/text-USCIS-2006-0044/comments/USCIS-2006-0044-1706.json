My husband and I are United<br/>States citizens - multi generational Floridians, born and raised ini Florida. <br/>Because of the cumbersome and daunting adoption rules in the USA, we decided to<br/>adopt internationally, through China.  China has a wonderful adoption program<br/>that looks favorably upon foreign adoptions.  Unfortunately, the entire process<br/>takes a long time and the USCIS I-171H has an expiration date that renders the<br/>form useless BEFORE the adoption can take place.  This means we have to get<br/>fingerprinted again and get another I-171H before we travel.  So, not only do we<br/>have to pay these very high fees once, we have to pay them TWICE because the<br/>form and the fingerprints usually expire before families can travel to get their<br/>babies.<br/><br/>The price of adoption is high enough already.  We are not rich.  We are working<br/>US Citizens who are working very hard and saving every dime we make to have<br/>enough money to have a family.  Please do not raise these rates that are already<br/>too high.<br/><br/>A possible solution to raising the rates would be to extend the life of the<br/>I-171H document.  If the life of the document was longer, USCIS workers would<br/>not have to process as many documents (it would cut their workload in half for<br/>each family/adoption from China).<br/><br/>Please reconsider this terrible increase.  Thank you for allowing me to comment.<br/> Please feel free to contact me to discuss this further.  <br/><br/>Sheryl Graham<br/>Key West, FL.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219ee7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:52:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:41:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sheryl L.
