The current funding gap of the USCIS<br/>is largely created by the inefficiency of the operation management and the<br/>outdated rules regarding the approval process. This created two problems.<br/><br/>1. The pending applications such as I-485 -- adjustment to immigrant status --<br/>have a long waiting period. This forces the applicants to apply for EAD cards<br/>and Advance parole or renew their H-1B applications during this time. This<br/>increases the workload of the USCIS and at the same time created more fee<br/>revenue of course.  <br/><br/>2. Applicants are left with no information about the progress of their cases<br/>and forced to contact repeatedly the only phone number USCIS provides, which<br/>does not answer any specific questions. The applicants are forced to resort to<br/>other means of contacting the USCIS -- through congressman, senators, and even<br/>whitehouse. Surprisingly, the USCIS does respond to these kind of indirect<br/>inqueries fairly quickly, while taking a long time to respond to direct inquiries.<br/><br/>The funding issue of USCIS should not be solved by raising the fees unfairly<br/>since the exising problems can be solved through technological improvement such<br/>as providing a transparent progress monitor and application-filing system<br/>through web-based software. E-filing some applications is already a reality.<br/>USCIS should extend this service to most applications. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a128", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T17:00:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T04:34:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Commented Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8020a128", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0766/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0766/attachments"}}}}}
