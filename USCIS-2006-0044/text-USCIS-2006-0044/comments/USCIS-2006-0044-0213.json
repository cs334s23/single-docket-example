This approval, once granted, is only good for 18 months and <br/>most adoptions take longer than 18 months.  So that means that the form must <br/>be submitted again with new fingerprints.  Can this 18 months be extended to 24-<br/>30 months?  Most international adoptions take about 24 months to complete, so a <br/>minimum of 24 months is needed.  By doing this, it would cut down on the <br/>amount of processing needed to be done at each USCIS location, and it seems <br/>that many of these locations already have a backlog, so reducing workload would <br/>be a good thing.  And it would also be a good thing for adoptive parents, as it <br/>would be one less form, in the mountain of paperwork required for adoption, that <br/>they need to worry about expiring.<br/><br/>thank you for considering<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fc872", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-07T16:25:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-07T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-07T14:14:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sheryl Prince", "trackingNbr": "801fc872", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0213/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0213/attachments"}}}}}
