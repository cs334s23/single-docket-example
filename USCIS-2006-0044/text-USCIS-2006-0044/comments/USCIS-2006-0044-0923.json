I<br/>know that for my pending case before USCIS, I would have been very happy to pay<br/>extra to have the process expedited. <br/><br/>For those of us, like myself, who follow immigration rules to the letter of the<br/>law, the process and lack of communication about any progress during processing<br/>is very frustrating. I understand that there are likely many applicants who are<br/>attempting to illegally gain entry into the US, but with the proper staffing<br/>resources, USCIS should and can provide the level of service that honest,<br/>hard-working citizens like myself deserve. <br/><br/>Lives hang in the balance for all of us with legitimate pending applications for<br/>immigration to the US. The hardship created for those of us separated from our<br/>spouses by the very lengthy processing times is beyond unbearable.<br/><br/>Also, it should be noted that the 6-months being reported by the USCIS website,<br/>is not at all accurate. I am not sure how the reporting to senior USCIS<br/>management is being rigged to report a 6-month average turn-around (I-130&#39;s),<br/>but this estimate shown on the USCIS website simply does not reflect the<br/>real-world situation.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Tom Siechert<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020af67", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T14:56:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-23T23:23:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tom Siechert", "trackingNbr": "8020af67", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0923/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0923/attachments"}}}}}
