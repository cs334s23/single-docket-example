Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit <br/>Application and Petition Fee Schedule<br/><br/>To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I write to strongly oppose the increase of immigration and naturalization fees that <br/>the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) proposed on February 1, <br/>2007.  Every day immigrants and refugees already struggle to pay immigration <br/>fees.  The steep increases proposed by USCIS would make it much more difficult <br/>to gain permanent resident status, reunite with family members, and become a <br/>U.S. citizen.  USCIS should be helping immigrants become citizens, not making it <br/>harder.<br/><br/>I know many people who want very much to become U.S citizens but can not <br/>afford to do so with the prices as they are right now. These fee increases would <br/>make it nearly it impossible for people to beome citizens ever. I do not see why <br/>the fees have to be increased, the services you provide are costly enough and very <br/>time consuming. Immigrants have enough problems without this issue being <br/>added on. We are hard workers who deserve more respect and humanity. We <br/>work to fulfill our everyday basic needs and if the government ever intends to make <br/>sure that there are no illegals in the country then this can never happen if they are <br/>creating more obstacles for immigrants.<br/><br/>USCIS claims that the fee increase is necessary to improve service, and USCIS <br/>definitely needs to improve service.  While I applaud USCIS?s efforts to improve <br/>service, I do not think that the entire cost should rest on immigrants who are <br/>already paying taxes, working hard, and struggling to pay high fees while receiving <br/>poor service.  <br/><br/>Immigration and citizenship are public goods that benefit our entire country and <br/>that we as a nation should help pay for.  Immigrants work hard, pay taxes, and <br/>help revitalize our communities.  In becoming citizens, immigrants demonstrate <br/>their strong commitment to their new home country by learning English, gaining <br/>knowledge about American history and government, and swearing allegiance to <br/>the United States.  We should be encouraging immigrants to become part of our <br/>community by gaining legal status and becoming citizens, not setting up barriers <br/>that block their path and keep them out.  <br/><br/>For all these reasons, I strongly oppose the proposed fee increases and urge <br/>USCIS to reconsider this proposal, and to seek other sources of funding for its <br/>operations, rather than add more burdens on immigrants.  Thank you for your <br/>consideration.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sincerely,<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Araceli Estrada<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a033", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:36:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:16:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Nydia Velasquez", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Araceli Estrada", "trackingNbr": "8021a033", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1752/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1752/attachments"}}}}}
