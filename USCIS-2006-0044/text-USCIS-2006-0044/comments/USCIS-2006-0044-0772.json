We are trying to adopt from China and the wait time is 17-18 months <br/>which means we will have to renew our application and cost us even more.  The <br/>adoption process is financially draining and more expenses are just not needed.  If the <br/>fees were going to increase than I would suggest increasing the time that the <br/>application is good for to 18-24 months so that adoptees would not have to refile.  This <br/>would decrease the work load of the USCIS officers and the hassel to the parents to <br/>renew the application.  I also understand that the same company that took our <br/>fingerprints for our homestudy agency is the same one that processes our fingerprints <br/>for USCIS.  Therefore they already have our records so you could consolidate the <br/>fingerprinting process into one time and save time and money for both the parents and <br/>USCIS.  <br/><br/>Thanks for listening!
