Adoption is a lenghty and<br/>unpredictable process.  I have already applied and paid the fees outlined in<br/>this petition.  It has become evident that my travel to China will come later<br/>than the expiration dates of all the applications.  I will need to reapply and<br/>pay once again all the fees in this petition.  Only this time they will be a<br/>drastic 66% more.  Adoption is an expensive process already and this petition<br/>unreasonably raises the cost.  I am only one of thousands of adoptive parents<br/>that will be hurt by this petition. I strongly object to this petition and find<br/>it completely unfair.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef6b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:19:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Deborah Bassino", "trackingNbr": "8021ef6b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2820/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2820/attachments"}}}}}
