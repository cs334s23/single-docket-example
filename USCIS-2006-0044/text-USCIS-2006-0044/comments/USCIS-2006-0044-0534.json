I teach Adult Ed and we have many students who are studying for <br/>citizenship. Additionally, dozens of previous students successfully passed their <br/>INS interview and are now citizens.<br/><br/>I believe the fees as they are today are already a hardship. Many of our students <br/>are working two jobs and can barely support their families, let alone afford the <br/>$400 application fee. Rasing the application fee to $595 will be a burden that <br/>many hardworking immigrants will not be able to afford.<br/><br/>Surely we&#39;re not saying as a country that we only want rich immigrants! But this is <br/>the message that is being heard.<br/><br/>Please, if you must raise the fees, raise them only a little. There are many other <br/>wasteful government programs where monies to improve immigration offices could <br/>be found. Don&#39;t take it out of poor immigrants who can little afford the fees as they <br/>are today!<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207f41", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T19:46:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T00:18:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Katherine P.
