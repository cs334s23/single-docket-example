The services overall have been abysmal, with federal workers doing work<br/>that in general population they&#39;d have been fired for.  <br/><br/>These fees are unacceptable, and with adoptions taking longer, and with no<br/>option of renewing 171h/797c approvals, the expense is astronomical.  I hope you<br/>will take the counsel of adoptive families, and decline to raise these fees yet<br/>again.  The fees keep going up, and the level of service we are paying for does<br/>not follow in accord.  There&#39;s absolutely no accountability in the Orphans<br/>Petitions offices across the country.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Valerie Martin,<br/>Adoptive Parent<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d7b6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:18:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T23:53:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Valerie Martin ", "trackingNbr": "8021d7b6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2450/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2450/attachments"}}}}}
