America was founded on the premise that we are an open<br/>nation, a place for many different peoples to come together and form something<br/>that is greater than the sum of its individual parts. By increasing the rates<br/>for international adoption, the government may be inadvertently closing one of<br/>the doors to legal immigration. Adopting is already an expensive proposition and<br/>while the increases may seem to be small and even reasonable, it may be removing<br/>one family from considering adoption, domestic or international, due to the cost<br/>of the endeavor. <br/><br/>Also, if one stops to consider a more macro scale. Adoption lessens the overall<br/>tax burden of each citizen. By adopting a child, the dollars required to support<br/>that child while they are a ward of the state would be lessened. By raising<br/>fees, the government would be discouraging adoption rather than encouraging it.<br/>Cost is always a factor in the lives of every American and this is just another<br/>hit in the pocketbook<br/> <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f189", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:07:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-03T00:09:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Trevor Pope", "trackingNbr": "8021f189", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2869/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2869/attachments"}}}}}
