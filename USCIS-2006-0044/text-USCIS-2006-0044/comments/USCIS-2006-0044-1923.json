My husband and I started the <br/>journey of international adoption in January 2006. At this point, we are going to <br/>have to pay the fee a second time for the I-600A, because ours will be expiring <br/>before we are able to go to China, the home of our future adoptive daughter. In <br/>addition to that, we will have to get our fingerprints done again (as well as pay the <br/>appropriate fees) before they &quot;expire&quot;. <br/><br/>The process of international adoption is very costly and I am not in favor of any <br/>increases that would make it even more difficult for my husband and I to continue <br/>in this process, as well as discourage loving couples who are not physically able <br/>to have biological children of their own from adopting a child or children that needs <br/>a home and a hope. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and I pray that you will take my opinion and thoughts into <br/>consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jennifer B.
