How a fee can almost double (as in the<br/>case of the N-600) seems to be an attempt to make up for short comings in other<br/>areas.  Why should people who are trying to make a better life for a child and<br/>ultimately our country be finanacially punished?  It also seems irresponsible to<br/>make such a large jump in fees when it has taken so long for a review of the<br/>fees to take place.  This also places a punitive cost on those people who are<br/>trying to make our society a better place.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c063", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:45:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T16:10:58Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021c063", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2217/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2217/attachments"}}}}}
