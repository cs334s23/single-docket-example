With $400+ billion <br/>going to (re-)build Iraq and with the largest amount of tax reductions going to the <br/>wealthiest citizens, it is a slap in the face to all fair-minded Americans to fund <br/>citizenship logistics by increasing the cost on those least able to afford it.<br/><br/>My wife came in through the K-1 visa program, and she had the benefit of a <br/>professional working husband to support her. Many immigrants are not so <br/>fortunate. Even with my support, my wife has found integration into America <br/>difficult. So, imagine how much more difficult for those without a stable economic <br/>environment to work within?<br/><br/>We should not be making it more difficult - financially - for people to get a footing <br/>in pursuit of the America dream. <br/><br/>And what about those already in the pipeline? I began the process of bringing my <br/>wife here in January 2006. Besides the K-1 fee, I&#39;ve had to pay a biometric fee, a <br/>fee for work authorization (EAD) and a fee for change of status (Green Card) ... <br/>nearly $1000 in all. And we are not done yet. In two years, she will be applying for <br/>unconditional residence. QUESTION: Since she is already in the citizenship <br/>pipeline, will future fees be locked-in to what they are now? Or will they be what <br/>they are in the future? <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f95a1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T15:27:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T13:37:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Roscoe Bartlett", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michael S.
