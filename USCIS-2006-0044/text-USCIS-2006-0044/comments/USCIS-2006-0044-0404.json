For example, in your document requesting the fee increase, your <br/>estimated time for completion of an I-129F is 2.9 months, but on your page listing <br/>currently processed I-129F forms, the most recent one is almost seven months <br/>old. Most sources I have seen give the actual processing time for this application <br/>as being between four to eight months. <br/><br/>Likewise, the I-130 form takes, according to the fee increase document, around <br/>six months. All other sources, including your own process date site, indicate a <br/>year or more - even up to two years.<br/><br/>Which numbers are correct? And why are the most optimistic numbers the ones <br/>you are using as justification for fee increases? And finally, will we see an end to <br/>the stories I&#39;ve read of how your Vermont office still files applications in milk <br/>crates?<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important issue.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206a22", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T00:28:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T22:00:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Charles Hesse", "trackingNbr": "80206a22", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0404/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0404/attachments"}}}}}
