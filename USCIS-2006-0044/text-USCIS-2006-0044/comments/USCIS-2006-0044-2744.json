I know <br/>of many potential adoptive parents who take out loans and charge most of the <br/>expenses on credit.  Many adoptive parents already have had their savings <br/>depleted due to the high cost of fertility treatments that are not covered by <br/>insurance....JUST TO BRING A CHILD INTO THEIR LIVES.<br/><br/>The federal government legitimizes adoption by offering a tax credit to adoptive <br/>parents.  The effects of the proposed fee increases, along with adoption agency <br/>fee increases and out-of-country fee increases, practically negates this credit and <br/>would simply make adoption unaffordable to many people.<br/><br/>I understand the need to increase fees, but not by 50% or more.  Be reasonable  <br/>and fair to the good people who open their homes to children in need of family.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ebd4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T13:14:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Deborah DeBraal", "trackingNbr": "8021ebd4", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2744/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2744/attachments"}}}}}
