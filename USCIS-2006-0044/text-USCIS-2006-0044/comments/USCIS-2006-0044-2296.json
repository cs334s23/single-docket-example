International adoption is an expensive process <br/>already and the raising of these fees, especially to this degree, will cause more <br/>children to never find a home.  I have adopted two daughters from China.  Both <br/>times, many of the major hurdles I faced came from our own US government <br/>processes, not from China.  If I felt like the processes had improved since that <br/>time, I might be in favor of a small increase, but I don&#39;t believe that has happened, <br/>so I don&#39;t think fees should be raised.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of my opinion!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cd9a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:03:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T16:12:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Melanie Mays", "trackingNbr": "8021cd9a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2296/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2296/attachments"}}}}}
