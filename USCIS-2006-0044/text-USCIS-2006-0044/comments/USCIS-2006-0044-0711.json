Biometrics (fingerprints) from $70 to $80 per person, and <br/>2.) the I-600A from $545 to $670.<br/><br/>With the extended ?wait? timeline for most international adoptions - most family will <br/>have to reapply for a I-600A to file a new 171H to allow our internationally adopted <br/>children into the United States.   We have absolutely no control over another <br/>countries timeline.  We do not feel the U.S. government should penalize us <br/>because of the expiration of the 171H while we wait for another country to play <br/>their political games with us.<br/><br/>The decision to adopt a child is often discarded because of the financial burden <br/>required of  families.  The average American who is interested in adopting a <br/>baby/child is not wealthy.  The average cost to adopt an international child is <br/>approximately $25,000 ? $40,000.  This is a significant financial hardship to an <br/>American family.  Why is it necessary to keep raising the cost of the biometrics <br/>and I-600A for families who are still waiting for their adoption to be finalized.  <br/><br/>In addition, please consider creating a clause to lengthen the 171H expiration <br/>timeframe for those families who have dossier?s on file and are waiting the referral <br/>of their baby/child.<br/><br/>Thank You for your reconsideration to incur this financial hardship upon us during <br/>this greatly anticipated journey to adopt our daughter from China.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Lee &amp; Melissa Rector<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480209438", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:46:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-17T19:45:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Self", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lee & Melissa Rector", "trackingNbr": "80209438", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0711/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0711/attachments"}}}}}
