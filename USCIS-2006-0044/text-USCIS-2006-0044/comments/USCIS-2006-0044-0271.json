Please reconsider the fee schedule which <br/>triples the current fee on some of the applications, but the processing times are <br/>very slow (years for some types). A better way would only be an increase in the <br/>fees with an acclerated processing time (like premium processing). This would be <br/>more appropriate and justified.
