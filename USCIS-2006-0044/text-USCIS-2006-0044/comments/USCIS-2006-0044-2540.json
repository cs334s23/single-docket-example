With <br/>Chinese adoptions anticipated to take as long as 3 years, families will not only <br/>have to file their I600A once and be finger-printed, but may go through this <br/>process as many as three times in order for their documents to not expire before <br/>they have completed the adoption. Most families who adopt are not celebrities or <br/>millionaires, they are middle and upper-middle class families. They are first-<br/>responders like police officers and fire-fighters, they are teachers, small business <br/>owners and regular people who go to work each day for someone else. People will <br/>take out loans to help finance their adoptions, and doing so doesn&#39;t make them <br/>less worthy of adopting - they simply want to parent a child that badly. Children <br/>will be born regardless of whether or not people are available to adopt them. I urge <br/>you to consider the larger impact a decision like this will have on our global <br/>society, for its impact will stretch beyond the US borders. Please do not increase <br/>your fees further.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>Margaret Kowal<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dcf0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:21:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T16:51:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Margaret Kowal", "trackingNbr": "8021dcf0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2540/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2540/attachments"}}}}}
