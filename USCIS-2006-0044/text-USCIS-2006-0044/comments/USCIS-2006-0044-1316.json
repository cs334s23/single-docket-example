It is currently estimated that the wait time is between 17-20 months and <br/>has been getting longer each month. By the time we get out match it is estimated <br/>that it will be 24-26 months after we were logged into the system in China. That <br/>time frame is longer than out I-600A is valid for. The costs of filing the I-600A is <br/>not cheap for most families as is the case for all of the adoption fees. Adoptions <br/>are very expensive and having to re-apply for a form that we have already filed for <br/>just because the US government has given it an expiration date that is unrealistic <br/>is unfair to families that are spending a lot of money to adopt a child. I rewuest <br/>that the expiration time of the I-600A be extended to at least 30 months in order to <br/>ensure that the families that have already filed and received their I-171H do not <br/>have to re-file again and spend another $685, or the proposed $830 when it <br/>expires.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480216b26", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-20T13:46:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-20T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-20T12:45:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Shawn M.
