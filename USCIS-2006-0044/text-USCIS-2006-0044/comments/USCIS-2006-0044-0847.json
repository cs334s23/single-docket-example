I am a waiting adoptive parent, <br/>adopting from China.  The wait time has increase significantly.  I have already <br/>been fingerprinted and have a I-171H.  However,  I will have to apply for another and <br/>get refingerprinted due to the expirations on the documents.  I have never gotten to <br/>use the one I have already paid for.  This mean that I will have to pay twice for <br/>fingerprints and twice for my I-171H.  By increasing the fees I will even have to pay <br/>more.  I have an average family income, trying to have a family through adoption.  <br/>This is the only way for my husband and I to have a child.  It is very difficult <br/>process and then to add more to this is very frustrating.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to let me voice my opinion.<br/><br/>Stacy Battaglini<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207abd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-23T19:33:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-23T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T19:05:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Stacy Battaglini", "trackingNbr": "80207abd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0847/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0847/attachments"}}}}}
