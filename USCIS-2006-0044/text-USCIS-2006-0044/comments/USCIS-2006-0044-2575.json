It is far too cheap and the <br/>immigrants who do not serve in the military do not appreciate what it is to be a US <br/>citizen.  US citizens can not work in other nations as my son has discovered.  The <br/>immigrants can stay in their own shitholes and leave us alone.  My grandfather <br/>was not permitted to vote until 1934 and his people had been here for 30 thousand <br/>years.  Limit immigration even more and stop allowing HB status.  Our young <br/>people are more than willing to work any job.  All my life I have been undercut by <br/>immigrants who will work for a few dollars an hour.  Maybe the price should be <br/>quadrupled.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de33", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:07:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T20:33:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adelaide Steely", "trackingNbr": "8021de33", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2575/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2575/attachments"}}}}}
