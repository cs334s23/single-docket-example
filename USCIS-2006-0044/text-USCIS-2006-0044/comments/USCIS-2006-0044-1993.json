These fees <br/>add approximately $2,000 additional dollars to the expected cost of well above <br/>$20,000 in total.  <br/><br/>We are supportive of our country and it&#39;s efforts to secure our borders and the <br/>safety of it&#39;s citizens.  However, I would request that the USCIS extend the <br/>expiration time of the I-171H to 24 months for those pursuing International <br/>adoption rather than contributing to the heavy costs incurred by families.<br/><br/>By extending the expiration timeframe for adoptive families, the additional <br/>workload of the USCIS employees who are having to re-process paperwork for <br/>thousands of adoptive families would be reduced, thereby reducing the need for <br/>additional employees and the increased payroll costs.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of this matter.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b54d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:12:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T18:11:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021b54d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1993/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1993/attachments"}}}}}
