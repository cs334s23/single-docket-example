Very much like in the private sector, where employees are evaluated<br/>and in most cases compensated according to his/her performance, it would seem to<br/>me that the government sector should have a similar policy.<br/><br/>I could not readily find evidence of work quality and work productivity anywhere<br/>in the current literature.  I was unsure where specifically the extra revenue<br/>generated will be applied to. Are there alternative venues to improve processing<br/>time? Is there a quota system per employee? Is there a training system in place<br/>to improve his/her time management or case study/processing performance? Are<br/>there measures to improve employee satisfaction in the workplace, which direclty<br/>correlates with better performance? What about the current leadership within the<br/>department? Are the leaders of the department the most qualified to perform the<br/>job? If so, what specifically is he/she missing to improve his/her goals, beyond<br/>extra revenues?<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa320", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T16:17:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-03T20:00:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801fa320", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0153/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0153/attachments"}}}}}
