Due the <br/>extended wait fimes, we will need to reapply for our I 171 H. This 2nd filing will <br/>increase our costs regardless of whether or not the rates are increased. Raising <br/>these rates will add to that burden. The overall financial costs are significant in <br/>adoption and these fees are one piece of that challenge for families.  My plea is <br/>two fold that the I 171 H time frame be extended to accomodate this extended <br/>wait period and that the rates are not increased. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020804a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T21:07:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T02:54:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Laurie A.
