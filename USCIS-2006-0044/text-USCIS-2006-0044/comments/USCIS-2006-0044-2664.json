For those in adoption <br/>processes, the waiting time is taking longer and longer.  The I-171H expires and <br/>people are having to pay twice nowadays.  Then, because our children are <br/>actually citizens upon arrival in the U.S., the fee for the Certificate of Citizenship is <br/>high enough and really shouldn&#39;t be necessary for our kids.  Even so, drastically <br/>increasing the fees on this form adds insult to injury.  Our kids should have been <br/>given documentation upon arrival in the U.S. due to the Child Citizenship Act of <br/>2000 and we should not have to pay for the COC.  Please don&#39;t drive fees up any <br/>higher on adoptive parents.  I currenty have my daughter&#39;s application in right now <br/>to avoid the higher fees.  I will then have to wait up to a year to get a document <br/>telling everyone my rightful U.S. citizen daugher is actually a U.S. citizen.  You <br/>will discourage future adoptions for families because the fees are just getting out <br/>of hand and a child will go without a forever family.  It&#39;s a real shame. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e45a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:37:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T18:10:22Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent, Kelly Nice", "trackingNbr": "8021e45a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2664/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2664/attachments"}}}}}
