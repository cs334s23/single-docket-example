I am a <br/>United States citizen currently in the process of adopting a child from another country.  My <br/>husband and I have been saving for years so we can start a family in this way. The current costs <br/>of adoption, whether domestic or international, run generally $20,000-$30,000 per child. This is a <br/>great financial burden for families like ours who cannot biologically bear children of our own.  Any <br/>fee increases will further burden an already costly process, and will make adoption prohibitively <br/>expensive for many families.  Please reconsider these fee increases.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c213", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:45:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T17:49:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021c213", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2225/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2225/attachments"}}}}}
