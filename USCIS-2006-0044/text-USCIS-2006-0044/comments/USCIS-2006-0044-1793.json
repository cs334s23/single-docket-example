The cost of adoption is ever increasing and although the government <br/>does offer a generous tax credit to defray the cost of adoption, many families are <br/>still left towing a much greater line than those able to have biological children.  <br/>Particularly troubling is the proposed increase in USCIS fees affecting adoptive <br/>families.  Many of these fees support documents that must be renewed due to <br/>increased waiting times for many programs.  Even the current fees are difficult for <br/>families to have to pay twice.  Increasing them will only create further financial <br/>hardship on those looking to expand their families and offer a home to a child who <br/>might otherwise not have one.  I ask you to consider any alternative possible not <br/>to increase these fees.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a1c1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:48:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T02:57:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sarah M.
