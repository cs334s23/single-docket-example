We serve low-income immigrants and refugees.  We <br/>provide family-based immigration services. We charge no fee or very minimal fees <br/>for our services. We have serious concerns that your proposed fee increases will <br/>make it impossible for many families to reunite in this country.  Our clients often <br/>need joint sponsors, because the household income does not meet 125% of the <br/>poverty guidelines.  It would not be possible for them to pay these increased fees, <br/>particularly for several family members processing at the same time; the fees <br/>would represent a significant percentage of their annual family income, which is <br/>already below or only slightly above the poverty level. In many instances they <br/>would be paying these fees while waiting years before further action is taken. <br/><br/>Immigration costs should not be borne by immigrants alone; immigration benefits <br/>the country as a whole and all citizens should bear those costs through taxes. <br/><br/>The practice of increasing fees at a time when US CIS has a very poor record with <br/>respect to timely adjudications, accurate decisions, competence in following the <br/>law and responsiveness, is distressing.  Prove that you can do your work on time <br/>and accurately and then ask for additional funding. We spend an inordinate <br/>amount of our time helping clients get US CIS errors corrected and know from <br/>experience how difficult it is to get any type of coherent US CIS response on the <br/>simplest of mistakes.  Examples include:  misspelling of names, incorrect <br/>beneficiary categories on receipts, wrong pictures on cards, incorrect birth dates, <br/>incorrect priority dates and much more.<br/><br/>We are particularly concerned about your proposed fee increases for the following <br/>forms:  I-129F, I-130, I-131, I-290B/Motions, I-360, I-485, I-601, I-694, I-751, I-765, I-<br/>824, N-400, and N-600.  <br/><br/>I-130:  A United States citizen with a spouse and four children would have to pay <br/>$1,775 to initiate the immigration process for his/her family.  And that is only the <br/>beginning of the costs to be incurred. The State Department costs, the costs of <br/>medical examinations, the costs of travel and often lengthy dislocation already <br/>make it difficult; US CIS increases would make the costs prohibitive.  If <br/>adjustment of status were an option, your proposed fees increases would turn this <br/>into a more than $6,000 process.  For poor families, this would be a tragedy.<br/><br/>I-485:  You propose a $905 fee, which includes Advance Parole and Employment <br/>Authorization.  The fee itself for a family with several members adjusting status is <br/>unconscionable. We have never filed an adjustment package which included a <br/>Form I-131, because our clients could not afford the current fee. They simply <br/>agree not to travel until the process is complete.  US CIS has advised recently not <br/>to file I-765s with adjustment packages, because the intent is to complete the <br/>adjustment package in a timely fashion and preclude the need for Employment <br/>Authorization Documents.  Therefore, we no longer file I-765s.  For children we <br/>never file I-765s and I-131s. But your proposal imposes those costs even on <br/>applicants who do not need or want those documents.<br/><br/>I-290B/Motions and I-694:  Applicants have very few remedies for errors and <br/>intentional disregard of the law by US CIS or DOJ employees.  The fees for these <br/>forms should be reduced, not increased, to permit applicants a reasonable <br/>opportunity to get the mistakes corrected, since these actions have such a <br/>dramatic impact on peoples? lives.  Your agency should have the same interest as <br/>applicants here: assure fairness and compliance with the law to the greatest <br/>extent possible.<br/><br/>I-360:  You are increasing fees for the most vulnerable applicants here.  Often <br/>families have been disrupted and the applicant is not even working.<br/><br/>I-751:  Since this aspect of immigration law is designed to prevent marriage fraud, <br/>your fee increase places an inordinate burden on those bono fide marriages where <br/>no fraud is involved.  What percentage of aliens approved as spouses engage in <br/>marriage fraud and are identified through the I-751 process?  If this percentage is <br/>not significant, this whole process and the time and money expended on it should <br/>be re-examined. <br/><br/>N-400:  Your fee increase here will assure that all eligible family members will not <br/>be able to apply to naturalize together.<br/><br/>N-600:  The N-600s we file are primarily for children whose parents have <br/>naturalized or who become citizens under the Child Citizenship Act, upon <br/>admission into the United States as Lawful Permanent Residents.  By law these <br/>clients are U.S. citizens.  They just cannot prove it without documentation.  <br/>Invariably this fee is an ?add-on? to fees already paid in the immigration process.  <br/>To deny an immigrant proof of his/her U.S. citizenship through a prohibitively high <br/>fee is seriously inappropriate.  Obtaining U.S. passports may clearly become the <br/>favored alternative process, but those must be renewed periodically.<br/><br/>Please do not do this.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sincerely,<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Marilyn S.
