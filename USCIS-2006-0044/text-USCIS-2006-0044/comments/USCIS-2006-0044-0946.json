Registered immigrants add to the U.S. <br/>economy and society as they pay taxes and fly above the radar. Non-registered or <br/>illegal immigrants do not pay taxes. <br/><br/>Why do the registered ones also then must pay more up front? It certainly does <br/>not make sense to me. $905 is far far too much to file a form, not matter how <br/>complex. Immigrating is not only difficult with the technicalities of the forms and <br/>having enough money in resources to qualify, but adding thousands of dollars in <br/>form fees force decent people to buck the system because they could never save <br/>that much money in their own countries. <br/><br/>The government does not need to take more money from these people trying to <br/>make a better life for their families.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bc66", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T20:25:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T18:44:59Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Julia E.
