Due to the slow down in the international <br/>adoption process with many of the countries most commonly utilized there is an <br/>increasing need for most families to refile their I600A and obtain new fingerprints. <br/>As many of these families struggle to come up with the initial fees and travel <br/>expenses associated with international adoption it seems there should be a better <br/>process in which the documents would all expire at the same time. If it was set <br/>that the I171H, the fingerprints and the homestudies all expired at the 24 months <br/>mark like the homestudies in Ohio currently do then many of the families would <br/>not have to refile at all. It is truly unfortunate these families are subjected to having <br/>to file for new fingerprints and I600A forms which consequently then require a <br/>home study renewal even though the home study is not expired at the 12 month <br/>or 18 month time frame that the other documents are expiring. Based on this <br/>alone I think it is unconscionable that an increase in fees is expected even <br/>though  for many of the families effected this will be a second filing rather than the <br/>initial. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f210", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:08:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-03T01:30:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sheri Blunt", "trackingNbr": "8021f210", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2879/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2879/attachments"}}}}}
