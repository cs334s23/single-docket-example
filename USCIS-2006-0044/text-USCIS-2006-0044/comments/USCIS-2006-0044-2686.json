So often the government does nothing to help the suffering children and <br/>when a good person steps up to help a child the government makes it harder <br/>instead of easier by putting up so many road blocks like this one.  You make it <br/>nearly impossible for someone to be able to help a child.  I think its disgusting <br/>that you put the almighty dollar over the health and well being of a child as if ther <br/>could ever be a price or dollar value put on a human being although you seem to <br/>have done that.  It&#39;s time to stop putting money before humans and I beg you to <br/>reconsider what you&#39;re doing to these wonderful people who want more than to <br/>give love and support and the promise of a future to a child.  <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e53b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:38:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T21:03:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lenda Van Lehn", "trackingNbr": "8021e53b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2686/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2686/attachments"}}}}}
