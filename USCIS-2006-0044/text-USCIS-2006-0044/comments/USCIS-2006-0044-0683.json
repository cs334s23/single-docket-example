The current <br/>restriction is 18 months but due to the increase in time of travel for adopted <br/>families this is not acceptable. <br/>  We as prospective parents have already paid the fees and filed all required <br/>documents for international adoption. Unfortunately, with the 18 month restriction <br/>we will not be able to travel to China and return before our I171-H expires. We are <br/>requesting that the timeline of 18 months be changed to 24 months. <br/>  It is so hard to deal with the fact of not being able to give birth to our on biological <br/>child. However, adoption has given us hope that we may still become parents. We <br/>have faced many fees, forms and emotions already to make this dream come true. <br/>It seems unfair and immoral to have to now pay additional fees, file more forms <br/>and recomplete fingerprints when we have not even been able to use the I171-H <br/>that we already have. <br/>  Please take this into consideration and increase the timeline to 24 months for all <br/>newly filed and existing I171-H applicants. Your attention to this matter is greatly <br/>appreciated.<br/>Sincerely, <br/>Tira Sokovich<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802090fc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:43:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T20:53:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tira W.
