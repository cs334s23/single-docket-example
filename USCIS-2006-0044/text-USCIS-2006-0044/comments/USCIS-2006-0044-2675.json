Adoption is expensive enough already, and it is <br/>unconscionable to raise fees by up to 66% for adoption-related petitions. What <br/>this makes me think is that there is a desire to dissuade families from <br/>international adoption simply by making it more costly to do so.  <br/><br/>Please keep in mind the fact that families are already spending tens of thousands <br/>of dollars on this process; and we are not wealthy families--we simply want to give <br/>homes to deserving children, and these petty fees raise more barriers in an <br/>already difficult process.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e50c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:38:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T20:35:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Kenny Hulshof", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Barnabas Abrams", "trackingNbr": "8021e50c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2675/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2675/attachments"}}}}}
