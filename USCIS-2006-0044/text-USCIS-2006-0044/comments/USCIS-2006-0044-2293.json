Next, <br/>more documents will expire.  The documents expire partially because of the govt <br/>time lag in processing.  We changed countries and needed to have 2 fields <br/>changed on the dossier: it took 2 months and only one field was changed.  It took <br/>2 more weeks to get the other field changed.  That is 2.5 months to change one <br/>document (it took only 10 days to get the first document through, along with the <br/>fingerprints of 3 people).  It takes so very long to get things processed and so <br/>much money that I cannot even fathom why you see the need to add more burden <br/>to us.  We had to save, borrow IRA, and remortgage our house for the adoptions.  <br/>If you add more or even double more, you will cut us off forever.  That cannot be <br/>your purpose, can it?  Why not lower the costs, extend the dates, and make it <br/>easier for us?  We are good little taxpayers  and intend to get more little <br/>taxpayers for you.  Please help us out?  We have always done what we should <br/>do.  Help us.  Do not hurt us more.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cd78", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:03:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T15:57:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Carol Green", "trackingNbr": "8021cd78", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2293/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2293/attachments"}}}}}
