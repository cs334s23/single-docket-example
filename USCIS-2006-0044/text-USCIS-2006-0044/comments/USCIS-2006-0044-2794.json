Today the exact same form <br/>costs a prospective adoptive parent $545. Biometric fingerprinting, which began in <br/>1998, has risen in cost from $25 to $70 per applicant. For a two-parent family <br/>adopting a single child, the USCIS process costs an upward of $685. Because of <br/>the instability concurrent with international adoption, many families find that their <br/>USCIS approval expires prior to their invitation to travel to their prospective child?s <br/>birth country. As a result, many families (especially those adopting from China <br/>and Guatemala) find themselves repeating the entire immigration application two <br/>or three times. This can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars, <br/>money many of us simply do not have. <br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing <br/>applications and with its customer service. Processing throughout the regional <br/>offices is erratic. Some I-600A applications take months to process, while <br/>individuals in other districts received approval of the exact same form within ten <br/>days. The refusal of officials to give adoptive parents priority results in children <br/>languishing in orphanages or foster care overseas for months and months at a <br/>time. Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers (I-140) and <br/>employment authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 and 1.97 months, <br/>respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned child (3.39 months). There is no <br/>explanation for why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected 859,543 I-765 <br/>and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A applicants. <br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are met with deaf <br/>ears and directed to a status website which is not updated. As a result of USCIS <br/>refusal to prioritize orphan petitions, thousands of children suffer needlessly. There <br/>has been no move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive parents whose <br/>documents expire while they wait for their child?s home country to grant them <br/>approval to travel. These parents are forced to reapply with USCIS, repaying the <br/>same exorbitant fees two and sometimes three additional times, each time <br/>subjecting themselves to the same long and uncertain wait for immigration <br/>approval. If USCIS would simply extend the expiration deadline for the I-171H from <br/>eighteen months to three years, it would significantly reduce its workload without <br/>having to increase its fees.<br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, are <br/>mortgaging our homes and cleaning out life savings to bring home a child. <br/>Increasing the burden is not simply unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of waiting <br/>children. We urge rejection of the current proposal and a new requirement that <br/>USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first priority to I-600/600A <br/>applications, consolidate the paperwork required for orphan petitions, and extend <br/>the expiration of the I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Michelle Vernon<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ee8b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T17:54:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021ee8b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2794/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2794/attachments"}}}}}
