I am a single <br/>mother who has adopted one daughter from Vietnam and I am in the process of <br/>adopting a second daughter (a 10 yr old girl) also from Vietnam.  The adoption <br/>process is already so expensive, and I have saved for years to make this second <br/>adoption happen.  There are so many kids out there who need homes, and this will <br/>make it even more difficult for their families who want to adopt them to bring them <br/>home.  It seems to me  like this is a bias against International adoption, because <br/>people who adopt domestically don&#39;t have to pay these expenses. Please <br/>reconsider these changes.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aba0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T13:57:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T00:27:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Laurie O'Neill", "trackingNbr": "8021aba0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1948/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1948/attachments"}}}}}
