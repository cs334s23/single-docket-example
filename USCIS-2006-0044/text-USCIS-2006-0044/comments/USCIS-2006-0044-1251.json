However, I do not believe that these fees <br/>are being applied to enough programs.<br/><br/>The H-1B non-immigrant visa for example, has a very low application fee, which <br/>encourages bodyshops and outsourcing companies to file for thousands of H-1B <br/>positions.  These large applications then cause the visa allocations to be completely <br/>used within hours of the annual opening, which in turn causes American companies to <br/>complain that more job-stealing visas are necessary in order for them to hire <br/>specialized workers.<br/><br/>If the H-1B application fee were set to 10% or 15% of the proposed annual salary <br/>($5,000 to $7,5000), then fewer companies would file for thousands of H-1bs, and the <br/>visa allocations would not be used for run-of-the-mill bodyshopping.<br/><br/>This one increase alone would be enough to support USCIS, and to provide for <br/>additional funds for enforcement.  The only people that would complain would be those <br/>bodyshoppers that are currently able to import thousands of low-paid, underpaid <br/>indentured servants.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480212829", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T14:20:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-11T19:11:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Walter R.
