However, it seems <br/>absurd to increase costs for legal immigration so sharply when USCIS has shown <br/>a total incompetence at keeping the millions of illegal immigrants out.  If some of <br/>the cost increase were to be targeted at enhanced border security, it might make <br/>sense, but it appears that the fees will simply go to building a larger, more <br/>cumbersome bureaucracy.  The larger the bureaucracy, regardless of the level of <br/>technology applied, the more likely internal problems (such as turf battles, inter-<br/>agency rivalries, etc.) will cause entropy and gridlock, and ultimately fail to <br/>anticipate and prevent the next threat to our security.  Nothing in this proposal <br/>guarantees an end result of faster processing and better security.  It only provides <br/>more hurdles and hoops for those aspiring to become American residents and <br/>citizens, and does nothing to impede the dedicated enemy of the US from gaining <br/>entry to our country.  In fact, increasing the difficulty of obtaining legal entry to the <br/>US will simply motivate potential terrorists or criminals (to say nothing of simple <br/>honest workers looking for a better life) to seek illegal entry, as the porous borders <br/>and lax enforcement of immigration laws makes it easier, less time consuming <br/>and safer than submitting applications for legal entry.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020d86b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-05T15:29:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-04T15:48:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8020d86b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1064/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1064/attachments"}}}}}
