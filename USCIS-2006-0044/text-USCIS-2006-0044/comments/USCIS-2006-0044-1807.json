These fees are already high enough to discourage some families from<br/>adopting a child from another country, at a time when there are more children<br/>desperately needing adoption.  Part of the rationale for the increase is to<br/>cover the cost of processing requests for asylum.  The government of the United<br/>States of America should not ask families seeking to adopt children to foot the<br/>cost of a normal, expected cost of government.  Many of these families are<br/>borrowing money, asking friends and family to help cover the cost of the<br/>adoption, taking on extra jobs,and reducing their savings to fund the adoption.<br/> Not every family has the resources of Madonna or Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>The proposed consolidation of the various fees into one fee is a great idea. <br/>That streamlining of the process should  save nearly enough money to obviate the<br/>need for the proposed increases.  It will certainly make the process easier for<br/>families seeking to adopt a foreign national child.<br/><br/>Why would an administration committed to preserving and supporting families put<br/>this additional obstacle in the way of people trying to extend American<br/>compassion and aid beyond our borders?  <br/><br/>This proposed increase in fees for foreign adoptions should be withdrawn after<br/>full public comment.  The proposed streamlining of the process should be adopted.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a596", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:49:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T11:22:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Mark Ellis", "trackingNbr": "8021a596", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1807/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1807/attachments"}}}}}
