I was, however, shocked by <br/>the rate of increase. As an adopting parent, I have already spent an enormous <br/>amount of money and had in my budget for the remaining fees I would need to pay <br/>in order to get my daughters citizenship. I feel that the amount of increase is <br/>unfair and unjust. I see so many people living off the system and those of us <br/>paying into the system are always being expected to pay more. I would at least <br/>hope that all adoptive cases currently in process would be grandfathered in under <br/>the current fees rather than the proposed ones. Unfortunately, a country that <br/>supposedly supports International adoption of orphans seems to make it more <br/>difficult and financially straining to most middle income families. That is a shame. <br/>I hope whomever has a hand in passing this increase also has a conscience.<br/>Thankyou for taking the time to read these comments. <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Correen Jones<br/>WA State<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a720", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T18:44:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T15:03:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Coreen A.
