My husband and I <br/>have recently adopted to special needs boys from South Korea last year. We had <br/>waited over 13 years to add childern to our family due to financial reasons. The <br/>fees for adoption are so extremely high already and are what kept us from our <br/>dream for so long. With the fee increase adoption would be out of the question for <br/>us in the future. We are just your average everyday citizen and do not have a <br/>wealth of money and these increased fees are a major hardship for us.<br/><br/>In adoption we MUST have the documents that the fee hike is proposed for and <br/>there is no other way for us to obtain these important steps to bring our childern <br/>home therefor we are at the mercy of our government and are begging you to <br/>reconsider how to cover your cost.<br/><br/>Anita McCrackin<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef41", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:03:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:06:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anita McCrackin", "trackingNbr": "8021ef41", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2812/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2812/attachments"}}}}}
