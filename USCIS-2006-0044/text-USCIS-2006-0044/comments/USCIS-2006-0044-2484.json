With international adoptions <br/>in some countries like China taking longer than 18 months to complete, you are <br/>adding an undue burden to adoptive familes because we will have to re-submit the <br/>paperwork since it isn&#39;t valid after 18 months.<br/><br/>It seems like just a few dollars, but when you multiply the whole fee by two, it <br/>really adds up.
