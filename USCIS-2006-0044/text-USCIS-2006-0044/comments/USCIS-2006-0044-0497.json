Because the wait is so long we are <br/>required to apply twice for the I600A in order to do fingerprints and receive the I-<br/>171H. The cost of adoption will be around $17,000 for us. This is extremely hard <br/>for us to save since we have one daughter from China in daycare. <br/>If you must raise the cost of the I600A, then please at least consider a lower fee <br/>for the second time. Fingerprinting twice for one adoption really adds to the cost of <br/>an already costly process. Money is very tight for us and will be even tighter when <br/>we have two children.<br/>Please help! Keep the fees down!<br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>Karen &amp; Bill Nest<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207d9d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T18:58:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T21:31:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Karen & Bill Nest", "trackingNbr": "80207d9d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0497/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0497/attachments"}}}}}
