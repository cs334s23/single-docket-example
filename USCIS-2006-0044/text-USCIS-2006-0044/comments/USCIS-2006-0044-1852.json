One reason international adoptions <br/>are so expensive are the US government fees.  To raise fees for citizens <br/>attempting to adopt from other countries is ridiculous - it should not cost over <br/>$400 to get a certificate of citizenship for your child! This will just dissuade people <br/>from completing adoptions in the future as the fees are already completely <br/>inappropriate.  To increase them is ridiculous and another example of government <br/>bureaucracy run amok. I think whoever proposed this is the same person that set <br/>the hours of operations for our local BCIS from 9-2 on M-F - I can&#39;t type anymore I <br/>am too angry and I think my time will be better spent reviewing who I will vote for <br/>in upcoming elections and protesting these rate increases with my local <br/>government representatives.<br/><br/>Amanda Bosch<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a8bc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:54:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:41:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Amanda G.
