However, it seems an <br/>unconscionable thing that the federal government would seek to profit off potential <br/>parents but certainly that is what this rule change would appear to do. A 66% <br/>increase is an undue hardship.  Perhaps if an increase is necessary to introduce <br/>the increase by increments.   Please consider the desire of parents to have <br/>children and the need of children worldwide to find good homes with loving <br/>parents.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in this matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely<br/>Amanda Moore<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab85", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T13:55:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T00:13:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Amanda J.
