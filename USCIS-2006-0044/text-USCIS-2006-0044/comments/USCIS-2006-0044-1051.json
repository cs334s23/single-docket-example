They named I-485 Fee as an example, which will increase to<br/>$905 from $325.  <br/><br/>However, USCIS neglects that fact that NOT ALL I-485 customers file for I-131<br/>and even less apply for I-131 twice.  Adding two-time fees for I-131 and saying<br/>the adjusted fee is only a 66% increase is not a convincing argument. <br/><br/>I do hope USCIS will enhance their services as well as reducing document<br/>backlogs as proposed.  However, what customers are complaining most about UCSCIS<br/>is their lack of customer care and I doubt whether it will be fixed by just<br/>putting more money in training. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020cd24", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-02T18:48:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-01T22:48:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kat K.
