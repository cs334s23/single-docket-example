I have the privilege of working with elderly refugees and immigrants, <br/>whose dearest hope is to become a citizen.  For many of them they have had to <br/>leave behind family and culture, and yet they are so grateful to be here, free and <br/>safe from harm.  I am grateful as well, for coming to know these elderly <br/>immigrants -- many of them persons of integrity and wisdom.  Without them our <br/>local community would be a poorer place.  <br/>For elderly immigrants the citizenship fee as it is poses a signifcant barrier.  I have <br/>met a 78 year-old woman who has resided in the United States for 16 years, and <br/>yet she remains a non-citizen, in large part because she cannot afford the fee.  <br/>Please reconsider your proposal to raise the citizenship application fee.  As <br/>William Youmans of Catholic Legal Immigration Network writes, &quot;The United <br/>States is an immigrant naton which is strengthened by the contributions of <br/>newcomers of all backgrounds.  Raising the obstacles to integration goes against <br/>this proud legacy.&quot;<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f972f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T19:02:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T17:18:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Judith Southworth", "trackingNbr": "801f972f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0013/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0013/attachments"}}}}}
