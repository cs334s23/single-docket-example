In most cases, we really are saving a life, and the <br/>costs are already very high. Consider alternatives of how to save money instead of <br/>raising fees. Efficiency in your agency along with streamlining the adoption <br/>paperwork would save you much more money than the proposed fees will ever <br/>raise for you. Ask any adoptive parent where there is waste of time and money in <br/>your agency and you will begin to understand where to start. If the fees continue <br/>to rise, many families who struggle to adopt will be forced not to adopt due to the <br/>costs alone. That could cost a child a life he or she could have had. Is that worth <br/>any amount of money? I think not.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c699", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:57:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T02:14:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent", "trackingNbr": "8021c699", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2258/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2258/attachments"}}}}}
