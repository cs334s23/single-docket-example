They can potentially obtain their work permits and also obtain work <br/>permits for their eligible dependents.<br/>This would increase tax dollars to the economy as several of them will chose to <br/>work and pay their taxes.<br/><br/>3) An approved EAD provides flexibility for an immigrant to shift employers also <br/>based on AC 21. <br/>This is the most important benefit of permanent residence: Ability to work for any <br/>employer without any processing. And having it will reduce the anxiety of having to <br/>wait for a Permanent Residence card to be acquired several years later.<br/><br/>4) This way by making a simple related procedural change, USCIS can satisfy the <br/>hearts of several immigrants who indeed will eventually contribute to the economy <br/>as they have over the last 500 years<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801ff01f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-09T20:05:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-09T14:44:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Mahesh Yelisetti", "trackingNbr": "801ff01f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0270/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0270/attachments"}}}}}
