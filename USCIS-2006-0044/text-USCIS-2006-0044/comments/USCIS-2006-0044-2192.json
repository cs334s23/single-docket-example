Many of us are already at <br/>our fingertips to try and bring these children of choice home. Try to think of the <br/>cost in human terms of raising these charges; children will not be brought home <br/>and many will languish far from the arms of those who want so badly to hold and <br/>love them. Surely the more diverse  a population in the US the less chance there <br/>is of other nations seeing us as isolationist and a law unto ourselves. Promote the <br/>awareness of of our citizens as good guys by allowing the common folk to show <br/>their care for the children of the world.
