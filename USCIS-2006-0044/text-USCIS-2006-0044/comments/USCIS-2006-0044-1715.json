Most families seeking to adopt outside of the United <br/>States are not wealthy. We do what we can to scrape together the $20,000 on <br/>average that it costs to complete an adoption. Raising these fees adds further <br/>burden to this already staggering sum and will surely reduce the number of <br/>orphans that can be adopted in the future. I urge you to reconsider raising the fees <br/>proposed in docket number (USCIS-2006-0044). <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219f3c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:53:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T21:11:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Pam H.
