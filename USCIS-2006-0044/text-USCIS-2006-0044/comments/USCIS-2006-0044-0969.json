I believe that there needs to <br/>be a revaluation of proposed fee changes to ensure a more reasonable change.  <br/>To more some people $800 can be almost their entire month&#39;s salary and frankly <br/>that is not fair.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020c24c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-28T15:54:19Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-28T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-27T20:36:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Adelita Hernandez", "trackingNbr": "8020c24c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0969/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0969/attachments"}}}}}
