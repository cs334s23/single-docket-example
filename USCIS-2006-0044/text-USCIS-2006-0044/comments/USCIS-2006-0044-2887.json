At this point we have spent considerable <br/>money for adoption fees, federal government fees, and passports. We spent <br/>money on passports in the belief that would be adequate for our children to prove <br/>citizenship but have been informed that a passport is not as secure as a COC. AS <br/>a result we will be forced to shovel out more money for the COC. I think it is time <br/>for the government to provide FREE COC&#39;s whenever a child is adopted. It does <br/>not seem fair that SOME internationally adoped children get COC&#39;s while others <br/>do not. It is time to even the playing field and to stop discriminating against <br/>certain groups of children. Therefore I propose to REDUCE the fees and in fact <br/>make a COC FREE to adoptive children.<br/>Sincerely<br/>Cheryl L.
