Adoption is an extremely expensive<br/>endevour.  Those of us who persue it could use all the help we can get from our<br/>own government.  Given that the time limit before expiration is not changing,<br/>many adoptive parents will have to pay fees twice in order to keep a current<br/>I171H form and fingerprints on file.  We are simply asking that the already high<br/>fees be kept at a reasonable level in order for adoption to remain a viable<br/>option to anyone who desires to persue it.  <br/>Sincerely, Beri Jenkins<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021df0c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T23:30:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "na", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Beri Jenkins", "trackingNbr": "8021df0c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2594/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2594/attachments"}}}}}
