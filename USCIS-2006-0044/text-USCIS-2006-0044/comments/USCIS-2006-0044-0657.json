I<br/>encourage you to look elsewhere to increase revenue or reduce the operating<br/>budget.  <br/><br/>As an adoptive family, we have paid substantial fees throughout the entire<br/>adoption process.  And many families have been involved in expensive infertility<br/>treatments before deciding to pursue an adoption.  It is heartbreaking to think<br/>of children that may never have a permanent family due to the costs involved in<br/>adoption.  Fee increases through the Department of Homeland Security and other<br/>agencies may exclude many wonderful potential parents from offering a loving<br/>home to an orphan.  <br/><br/>Please consider the number of visa applications issued to bring a child home<br/>from China.  Due to the increased time line on the part of China to receive a<br/>referral, many families including my own will be required to reapply for an<br/>updated I-171H.  This means we will be paying the required fees twice, without<br/>ever using the first approved I-171H.   <br/><br/>It would be reasonable to maintain the current fees throughout the time period<br/>in which families must apply twice, as this generates additional revenue. <br/>Reconsider increasing your fees when the time comes that families adopting from<br/>China only need one application due to either Congress extending the expiration<br/>date of the I-171H or China decreasing the period of time to issue a  referral.  <br/><br/>I appreciate the opportunity to comment on your proposed fee increases.  Thank<br/>you for taking the time to seriously consider our opinions on the matter as you<br/>weigh all of you options.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kerrie Grove<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208914", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T20:26:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T14:24:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kerrie J.
