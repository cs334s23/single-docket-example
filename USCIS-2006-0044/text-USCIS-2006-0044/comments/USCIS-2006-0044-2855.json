The proposed new increase in fees <br/>seems very unfair to us.  We have done all of our paperwork properly and filed promptly.  However, <br/>the time from application to a having a child mathced to you has increased substantially.  <br/>Therefore, due to no fault of ours, our paper work will be expiring and we will have to reapply.  We <br/>understand the need to have current documents; however, it grossly unfair to raise these fees.  In <br/>fact we would suggest the renewal fee for expiring documents for the same child be decreased.<br/><br/>We apprecitate your consideration in this matter.<br/><br/>Chris &amp; Jody Lawson<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f0a1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:06:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T21:41:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jody Lawson", "trackingNbr": "8021f0a1", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2855/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2855/attachments"}}}}}
