Adoption related fees are <br/>already a burden on prospective parents, particularly when the time frame of the <br/>adoption process goes beyond the expiration dates of the required USCIS <br/>immigration documentation. Adoptive families have no control over the processing <br/>time, therefore it is a great burden when we are required to reapply for I-600A, <br/>fingerprints, etc because these documents expired. Since we are a country that <br/>has a great reputation for humanitarian efforts and the support of families, I urge <br/>you not to increase these fees.
