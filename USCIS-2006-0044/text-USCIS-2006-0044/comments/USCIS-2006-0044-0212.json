My I-485 <br/>application has been pending for 2 years and no any progress at all. Every time <br/>when I check with USCIS, the answer is pending on name check, please wait. <br/>They decline to give a clearly time frame they can complete the process. <br/>    I am a legal tax payer here, and specifically USCIS is living on the immigrants. <br/>But we can&#39;t get any fair and guarenteed sevice from them. That&#39;s unfair and not <br/>correct in such called equity United States. <br/>    The immigration application fees already increased a lot compare with serveral <br/>years ago. But the service from USCIS didn&#39;t improve at all, I should say it <br/>become worse and worse. I have been waiting for my green card for 5 and half <br/>years, and it&#39;s normal, lots of my friends waiting for even longer. The waiting time <br/>for the green cared is history long now. Increasing the fee just make the <br/>immigrants more like the slaves, and the officer get more reasons to become lasy <br/>since the money comes so easy. <br/>    So the only way to improve USCIS service is to find a method to provent the <br/>govement from abusing their power, not increasing the fees.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>Yong<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fc499", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-07T16:25:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-07T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-07T07:32:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Yong Peng", "trackingNbr": "801fc499", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0212/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0212/attachments"}}}}}
