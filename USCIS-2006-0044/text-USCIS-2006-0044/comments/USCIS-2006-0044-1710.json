The costs to adopt are already incredibly <br/>high and prove to be prohibitive for some families who not only have to come of <br/>with the money to cover the adoption, but then have to find a way to cover the <br/>costs of day-care and eventually college tuition.  How do we save enough money <br/>to cover it all?  Increased fees will cause families to consider alternate options.  <br/>There are SO many children that need us.  Please do not increase these fees.  <br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219efe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:52:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:50:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Cathy McMorris", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kori A.
