Right now the major reasons <br/>people come to the US is to be able to work to improve their lives back home. If <br/>they had the funds already they wouldn&#39;t be coming here. I think by increasing the <br/>cost unnecessarily, fewer people will be able to legally immigrate and more people <br/>will turn to alternative immigration resources. If the increease funds could <br/>guarantee an increase in customer service or a more sophisticated processing <br/>method, or new equipment to make the process faster and more efficient then this <br/>should be explained at the time of the increase. From my understandign of the <br/>situation there is no benefit to the immigration process from the immigrants view. <br/>Already a student who is gettign an education inthe US is not eligible for any sort <br/>of aid and is paying the most of all students for tuituion(ie $32,000.00/yr) and can <br/>only work on campus for 20hrs per week at $5.15/hr can not afford to pay over <br/>$300.00 for a work permit for 3mo in summer and then re-apply again for the same <br/>cost during their winter break for 1mo. This is too burdensome. If the fees are to <br/>increase there should be some legal means of meeting the fee cost.  When you <br/>consider that previous immigrants paid $0.50 to immigrate for life to the US, one <br/>can not help but wonder if because of the skin of current immigrants people feel it <br/>is more acceptable to penalize and restrict them to this unconstitutional degree.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ee7f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T17:52:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021ee7f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2793/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2793/attachments"}}}}}
