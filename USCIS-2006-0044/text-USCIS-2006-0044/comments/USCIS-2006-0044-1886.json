My husband and I also have 4 biological children.  Our <br/>motivation for adoption was to give a home to a child in need, but we are the ones <br/>who have been blesssed, by becoming the parents of a wonderful little boy.  When <br/>recently informed that the fees would be increasing again, I was discouraged.  So <br/>many couples have told me they would adopt if not for the incredible costs. Let&#39;s <br/>not make it worse. Let&#39;s do things to help REDUCE the cost of adoption so that <br/>more families will be encouraged to step forward and help the orhans in our world <br/>and so that we make it easier for those who are unable to have biological children <br/>to become parents. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a94a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:57:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T18:51:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kelly McCashen", "trackingNbr": "8021a94a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1886/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1886/attachments"}}}}}
