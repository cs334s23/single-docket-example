It is a <br/>very expensive process already....a 66% increase is offensive!  Please don&#39;t use <br/>adopting families as a profit center!  I understand costs increase over time but an <br/>increase of this magnitude is truly outrageous.  Many of us go through repeated <br/>rounds of documents as we wait for int&#39;l adoptions to be completed; in my case I <br/>had to redo my entire dossier because of delays abroad, including my USCIS <br/>documents, FBI checks, etc.  Increasing the USCIS fees as proposed would be <br/>another significant hurdle in the process that is already expensive and time <br/>consuming.  If you need to increase fees to reflect increased costs, make a COLA <br/>adjustment -- but not an increase of 66%.
