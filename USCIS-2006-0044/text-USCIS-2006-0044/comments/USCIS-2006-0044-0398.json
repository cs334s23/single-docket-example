Increasing fees will not result in less immigrants. <br/>It will most certainly increase the number of illegal immigrants in the country at <br/>the current time. Fees being increased so much will scare new immigrants away <br/>from filing for residency or other documents as needed. Instead they will hide <br/>away. Wait times are long, but long wait times are better than increased fees and <br/>increased illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>Not only will it increase your fees, but also it will increase complaints and the <br/>work that is done outside of the actual service centers. Currently fees are at a <br/>high rate, especially for a new immigrants and therefore many complaints will be <br/>filed by increasing fees. This will only cause more work for you in responding to <br/>such complaints. The time saved will be minimal if any, and more than likely will <br/>increase problems.<br/><br/>After reviewing the policy, I think that you will agree that increasing fees will not <br/>increase revenues for the company, will not decrease the number of immigrants <br/>coming to the United States, but only those coming illegaly, and will greatly <br/>increase the headaches of each and every individual at your company. The new <br/>fee proposals should be rejected and left where they are at to keep things going <br/>slowly but smoothly.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Jeff Tenney<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206448", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T00:22:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T17:35:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jeff Tenney", "trackingNbr": "80206448", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0398/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0398/attachments"}}}}}
