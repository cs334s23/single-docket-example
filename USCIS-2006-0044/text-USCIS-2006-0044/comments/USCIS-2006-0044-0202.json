There seems to be no need: the US government does not need<br/>the extra money. However increasing the fee by more than 50% makes it a lot more<br/>difficult for those applying. The US seems to be doing themselves a disservice<br/>in this, as this country can greatly benefit from the depth of diversity and<br/>wealth of life experience these people would be bringing as US citizens. Making<br/>it harder for them to become citizens will be hurting everyone involved.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fba36", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-06T17:10:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-06T16:58:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sophia J.
