Right now, there is a discrepancy between adoption<br/>times (which have increased dramatically in the last several years) and the<br/>period of time the I-171 remains valid. Due to this discrepancy, right now<br/>parents adopting from the PRC will have to file the I-600 **TWICE**, and<br/>therefore the current proposed fee increase appears, to me, onerous. <br/><br/>A change in fee, if implemented, should be accompanied by an equivalent increase<br/>in the duration the I-171/I-600 remains valid. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020f29e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T18:42:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-08T01:38:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Caroline C.
