I am an adoptive parent, or actually a waiting adoptive parent.  There are <br/>many many fees involved in an international adoption.  The costs associated with <br/>an adoption are what many would consider exorberant.  But as adoptive parents <br/>we pay them.  It seems unreasonable first, when most adoptions exceed the <br/>allowable time on the I171Hwhich is currently 18 months, and 12 months for our <br/>fingerprints.  So not only are we required to pay these fees once, but 95 percent of <br/>the time families are taxed with paying these fees twice.  And now you want to <br/>force us to pay an increase in these fees, twice!!!  Let&#39;s be fair about this.  For <br/>many of us adoption is the only choice we have to have a family.  We prove over <br/>and over again that we are suitable parents, by many governmental institutions.  It <br/>seems that we are being treated unfairly.  I am one of those families that have <br/>been waiting in excess of a year.  Our fingerprints expire in two months and our <br/>immigration expires in 8 months.  Which unfortuanately will force us to pay fees <br/>we have already paid once to get a form we already have...AND now we are going <br/>to have to pay an even higher fee for forms we already have.  IT&#39;s unjust and unfair, <br/>and just plain not neccessary.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c414", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:51:25Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T20:51:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ann Crews", "trackingNbr": "8021c414", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2238/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2238/attachments"}}}}}
