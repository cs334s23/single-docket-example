I understand you need to raise your<br/>application rates.  Everything is increasing these days and you have a right to<br/>cover your costs..  I strongly urge you to have a clause that &quot;granfathers&quot;<br/>those of us who have already paid, but because of the extended wait times, will<br/>have to reapply and not only pay your fees again, but now we will have to pay<br/>the increase.  International adoption is an expensive endeavor and makes it<br/>difficult for some of us to afford this tremendous opportunity.  I hope you will<br/>consider those who have to now pay this fee a second time.<br/><br/>I appreciate your consideration in this matter and for allowing us to make<br/>comments regarding the changes in your fee structure.<br/><br/>Best regards,  Emily Gwynn <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802094e5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:47:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-18T22:24:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Emily F.
