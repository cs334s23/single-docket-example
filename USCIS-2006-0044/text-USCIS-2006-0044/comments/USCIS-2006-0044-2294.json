I would think that if you are going to <br/>increase fees that you would at least be increasing services and time frames for <br/>our paper work to get filed!  Adopting is an extremely expensive and emotional <br/>journey for families willing to take on this challenge.  <br/>With the proposed increases this is what it will look like for us:<br/>Here is what it costs to file with USCIS for a couple just to adopt:<br/><br/> <br/>What it used to be when adoptions took place within 18 months:<br/><br/>I600A:  $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints:  $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total:    $685<br/><br/> What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/> <br/>I600A:  $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints:  $80 x 4 =   $ 320<br/><br/>Total:    $1660<br/><br/> That?s an increase of $975 or over 140%!  That?s how much more USCIS will <br/>make on just us, adopting parents, with no increase in services.<br/><br/> And that?s not even taking into consideration the fact that applying for our <br/>children?s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) goes from $215 to $460, a <br/>difference of $245 or about 120% increase.  Sometimes, we don?t even get the <br/>certificates for a year after filing!<br/><br/>This is absurd!<br/><br/>I hope you see the real challenge that Adoptive parents already face and the <br/>expenses that go with it.  We are adopting from Guatemala and our final amount <br/>we will be paying is going to be around $36,500!  <br/>So for the increase of fees WITHOUT and increase in timelines or services would <br/>be completely uncalled for and unfair to all of us American Citizens that choose to <br/>bring an orphan that needs and deserves a family into our family here in the United <br/>States - Home of the Free and Land of the Brave!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cd80", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:03:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T16:00:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent, Amanda Anderson", "trackingNbr": "8021cd80", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2294/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2294/attachments"}}}}}
