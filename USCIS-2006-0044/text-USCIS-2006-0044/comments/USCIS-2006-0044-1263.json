I have waited six (6) <br/>years for the first sign that my request is in process. It will still take me at least <br/>six years more to become a US citizen. And I mean no disrespect: All the fees <br/>are paid in full and up front. The service is slow, non transparent, and expensive as <br/>it is. I see myself spending so much time and resources applying for documents <br/>and paperwork, Fed-Ex-ing documents all over the place, and noone is regarding <br/>the added cost. And here is the biggest impact: The cost of fuel has put families in <br/>a position that they are re-considering flying to visit their families, effectively <br/>choaking the aviation indistry. If the cost of advnace parole is now going to be <br/>$500 per person per year, people are going to either not fly or eventually leave <br/>alltogether, depleating the US of it&#39;s capable workforce and willing LEGAL <br/>immigrants. Small changes now are going to result in large problems in the future.<br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480212dd5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T15:52:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-12T15:33:44Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Don Foris", "trackingNbr": "80212dd5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1263/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1263/attachments"}}}}}
