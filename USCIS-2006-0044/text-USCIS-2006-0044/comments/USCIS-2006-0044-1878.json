If it were cheaper to <br/>adopt in this country you would have even fewer people on welfare (what a <br/>concept). Please - we&#39;re not asking for you to make it cheaper - just DON&#39;T <br/>RAISE the costs. Aside from the few Hollywood do-gooders, it&#39;s the middle class <br/>in this country that does nearly all of the adopting. We are already shouldering <br/>more than our share of the burdens required to work hard and prosper in this great <br/>country. Please don&#39;t make it more costly to adopt.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a916", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:56:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T18:27:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Karl & Julie Voelkel", "trackingNbr": "8021a916", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1878/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1878/attachments"}}}}}
