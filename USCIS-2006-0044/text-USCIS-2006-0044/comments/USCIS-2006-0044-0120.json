Becoming an American citizen is something every immigrant wishes<br/>for and after being here in the country legally for several years and going<br/>through all<br/>necessary wait time and paying taxes, its discouraging to see that USCIS<br/>proposes a massive increase in filing fees.<br/><br/>1--&gt; As a percentage of income, the increase in fees will likely hit hard on<br/>people who can afford the least.<br/>2--&gt; Since the cost of becoming a citizen increases, immigrants will be less<br/>likely to get involved in local elections and communities since they cannot vote.<br/>3--&gt; Also, immigrants likely miss out on rendering their exceptional service to<br/>state and federal govt, since government jobs require most applicants to be<br/>citizens..<br/>4--&gt; On the long run, citizens of US will likely play greater role in advancing<br/>its interest elsewhere in the world so a less than painful process for<br/>immigrants would benefit everyone.<br/><br/>Sincerely.<br/>Praveen<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa15b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T18:51:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T18:06:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Praveen Panati", "trackingNbr": "801fa15b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0120/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0120/attachments"}}}}}
