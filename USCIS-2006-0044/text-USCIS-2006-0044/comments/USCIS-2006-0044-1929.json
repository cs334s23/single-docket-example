In this case this <br/>service is mandated for adoption and it is like being held hostage to increase fees <br/>by this margin.  Surely with new processing and automation, costs can be covered <br/>by the increase of request and still make this a not for profit type business.  I <br/>cannot fathom a government entity that has an inherent design to make profit while <br/>it still has the ability to collect taxes.  Fees should cover cost and expense and <br/>not be used to profit or fill other coffers.  If expenses have made it feasible to raise <br/>the fees to this extent then this is outright poor management and a gradual <br/>increase would be more pallatable.  Please do not raise the fees associated with <br/>this proposal as it is absurd to raise them by such an average increase.  Let&#39;s use <br/>some common sense and not mandate processes with absurd amounts of cost.  <br/>Thank you. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab04", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:58:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T22:34:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "unknown", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Troy T.
