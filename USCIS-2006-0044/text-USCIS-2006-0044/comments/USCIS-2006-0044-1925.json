International adoption is already very<br/>cost prohibitive for many.  With extended wait times, many families such as<br/>mine, have to re-apply for our I-600 and re-do our fingerprints.  So, we are<br/>already paying these fees twice.  To increase them will overly burden us and may<br/>unfortunately result in many children living their lives in orphanages, instead<br/>of loving homes.  Please don&#39;t make it harder to adopt!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aade", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:57:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T22:07:58Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Krista L.
