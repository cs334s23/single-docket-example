I am <br/>trying to adopt a baby from China and I can&#39;t tell you how expensive it is without a <br/>huge increase in fees.  You know the expression, &quot;nickel and dime you to death&quot;? <br/>I feel like I am being &quot;hundred dollared&quot; to death for doing something that is at its <br/>core a good deed.  I am not sure that these fees are something that should be <br/>based on full cost recovery.  A greater public good is being served by a private act <br/>and some recognition, in the form of a cost break should be considered.  I am not <br/>saying get rid of the fees entirely, but don&#39;t start raising them so high that it <br/>discourages people from doing something good.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>I am a manager at a local government agency that is mostly fee-for-service, so I <br/>know a little bit about what it takes to recover fees.  No one ever wants to pay the <br/>full cost of what it takes for us to provide a service.  That being said, I also know <br/>that if I tried to increase the fees over the programs that I supervise by 60%, I&#39;d get <br/>strung up at the next Council meeting.  60% in one year seems excessive and I <br/>would urge you to consider raising fees in a different area than one that effects <br/>foreign adoption.    <br/><br/>Thank you for your time,<br/><br/>Jenifer Gilliland<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a0ea", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:04:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T00:53:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jennifer Gilliland", "trackingNbr": "8021a0ea", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1770/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1770/attachments"}}}}}
