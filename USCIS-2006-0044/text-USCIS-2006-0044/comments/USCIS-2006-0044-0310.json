I understand the dept. of Homeland Security is overloaded with <br/>immigration applications and needs to increase fees.  My concern is that Int.l <br/>adoption fees (I-600, N-600 and Certificate of Citizenship for IR-4 children) are <br/>lumped in with the immigration fees.  The proposed fees for those applications are <br/>pretty large increases.  This will affect thousands of families in the process &amp; <br/>considering adopting children internationally when the cost is already extremely <br/>expensive.  Please consider not increasing the fees for Int.l adoption applications.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480201da8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-12T19:50:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-12T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-12T03:35:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Stacy Robben", "trackingNbr": "80201da8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0310/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0310/attachments"}}}}}
