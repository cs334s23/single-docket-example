My labor 4/2002 and I am EB3 and the date is <br/>retrogessed for my country.<br/>So while I am waiting for GC which no body knows (can take 3/4 years) I have to <br/>constantly renew my EAD and AP. This is for me and my wife. This additional fee <br/>increase means total around $1200 EACH year for the next 3/4 years. <br/><br/>I dont understand why EAD/AP cannot be for 3 years time period instead of 1 <br/>year. This way USCIS also does not need to do this extra work. <br/><br/>I strongly oppose this fee increase. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480209443", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:46:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-17T21:46:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "80209443", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0712/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0712/attachments"}}}}}
