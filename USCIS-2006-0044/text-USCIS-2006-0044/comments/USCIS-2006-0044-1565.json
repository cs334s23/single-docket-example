With no gurantee of<br/>better service, what good will higher fees do?  Just this past week, after<br/>following the instructions on the CIS website exactly, my I-600A was returned<br/>because I paid with a personal check.  Despite the CIS website saying personal<br/>checks were acceptable, our local office no longer accepts them.  The<br/>inconsistency from office to office is astounding.  Some allow your biometrics<br/>to be done before your application is complete, some don&#39;t.  Some take weeks,<br/>some take months and months.  <br/><br/>My biggest issue, however, is the proposed increase in the N-600, application<br/>for the Certificate of Citizenship.  Under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, my<br/>child automatically became a US Citizen.  However, I still have to pay for a<br/>certificate to prove it?  The fee is nearly doubling for a piece of paper that<br/>families are waiting up to a year for and often have to drag their young child<br/>to an interview with a CIS official.  All children who enter the US on IR-3<br/>Visas receive this document automatically in the mail at no additional cost.  If<br/>CIS wants to save money, why not do the same for children who enter on IR-4<br/>visas after proof of full and final adoption is supplied?<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480217cbd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-22T15:59:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-22T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-22T04:15:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Nicole McDonald", "trackingNbr": "80217cbd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1565/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1565/attachments"}}}}}
