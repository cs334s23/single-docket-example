This is a<br/>very bad news, and it is a WRONG suggestion.<br/><br/>From me, It takes too much time to process the immigration and Citizenship<br/>application is simply your process is too commplicated, not very efficincy.<br/>You&#39;d better simply your process and put a working quata requirment on your<br/>processing stuff, to be honest, I really doubt if your immigration officers are<br/>really working hard to process the applications ...<br/><br/>As an foreign engineer, I absolutely opposes your proposal to increase fee.
