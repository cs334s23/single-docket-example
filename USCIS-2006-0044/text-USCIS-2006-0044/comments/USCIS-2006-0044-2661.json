They are not too<br/>high to pay once, but the fact of the matter is that many of us who are adopting<br/>to pay for them twice because the entire adoption process takes so long.  This<br/>is ridiculous.  <br/><br/>The entire process needs to be evaluated and streamlined.  I&#39;m sure it costs a<br/>lot to do everything the way it is done now, but it needn&#39;t cost so much because<br/>so much of the work is done more than once.<br/><br/>Until the whole process is reconsidered, it is unconscionable to raise the prices.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Elin Melchior<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e431", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:37:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T17:36:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Elin Melchior", "trackingNbr": "8021e431", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2661/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2661/attachments"}}}}}
