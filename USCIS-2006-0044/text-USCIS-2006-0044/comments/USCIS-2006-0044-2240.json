This great <br/>country of ours supports so many other causes for humane efforts, yet it not only <br/>makes it extremely difficult for people in the US to adopt foreign-born children, it <br/>also adds to the financial burden.  Currently some of the documents required by <br/>potential parents in the United States expire before the adoption can be <br/>completed, mandating that these fees be paid not once, but twice.  Now you are <br/>planning to increase these fees on top of that.  It is a complete scandal that you <br/>would even consider such action.  Please immediately reverse this docket now <br/>before it is passed and stop adding to the burden of parents who are trying to <br/>make this world a better place by giving a home to a child who would otherwise <br/>have none.  <br/>Respectfully, <br/>Marilyn B.
