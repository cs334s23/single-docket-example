I am <br/>not asking for hand outs.  The process of adoption can be an opportunity for <br/>multiple agencies to &#39;nickle and dime&#39; you to death and in many ways you will pay <br/>for every paper clip used because of the dream of having a family.  I have made <br/>the choice to adopt from the millons of abandoned children and I realize I am <br/>going to half to pay almost $20,000 out of pocket or in my case the cost is being <br/>put on a Visa with 8.9% with very little grumbling.  I am aware that I am being <br/>nicked and dimed.  My medical insurance will not pay for a physcial or any blood <br/>tests that might be used for adoption.  They would pay for all this if I was <br/>pregnant...I guess I was a little put out when I received information that now the <br/>Federal gov&#39;t wants to get their nickle and dime me too just because I can&#39;t have a <br/>biological child!  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219fe1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:19:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T22:28:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Deborah E.
