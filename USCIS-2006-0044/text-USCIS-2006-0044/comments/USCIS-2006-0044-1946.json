We realized this <br/>process was going to be both time consuming and costly, however our desire and <br/>willingness to make a difference in a child&#39;s life outweighs any of these factors.  <br/>We have completed a large part of the process and are currently waiting for a <br/>referral, which can be another year away.  We are concerned about the proposed <br/>orphan petition increases in terms of their reasonability and justification.  For <br/>example adoption petition fees will increase 66% if this adjustment passes.  Is <br/>such an increase justified?  Will these increases assist in fixing other Homeland <br/>Security issues (i.e. illegal immigration)?  Will they speed up processing times?<br/><br/>Both my wife and I are committed to this country and our decision to adopt.  <br/>Please do not take advantage of our position unless it?s for the greater good of the <br/>nation and not a means of producing revenue.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab95", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T13:56:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T00:16:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "John J Hall", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anthony D'Angelo", "trackingNbr": "8021ab95", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1946/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1946/attachments"}}}}}
