Our <br/>organization helping with immigration issues for immigrants and refugees <br/>from Eastern Europe. Many families did not apply for Citizenship, because <br/>they can&#39;t afford $400. We can&#39;t imagine how they can afford sub increase. <br/>I/we think that the propose fee increase is too much, we agree some <br/>increase but no that much, the fee increase should be no more than 15%. <br/><br/>Thanks, <br/><br/>Larisa Podgorny<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # ", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a143", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:19:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T12:04:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Program Director", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Larisa V.
