These fees are collected from prospective <br/>adoptive parents who are planning to adopt orphans internationally.  The costs of <br/>adoption are already very expensive and adding to those costs will result in fewer <br/>orphans finding their forever families and instead aging out of their country&#39;s <br/>orphanage system.  The statistics of what happens to those children are very <br/>grim.  Due to the lengthy wait to complete adoptions, many parents must <br/>reapply and pay the associated fees for  their I-600/I-600A applications becuase <br/>their I-171H has expired prior to the adoption being completed.  If the cost to <br/>process I-600/I-600A applications is more costly than the current fees, I would not <br/>oppose the increase in fees, if and only if, the expiration dates for fingerprints and <br/>I-171H are extended to reflect the amount of time it takes to complete nternational <br/>adoptions.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comment.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ac22", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:10:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T01:48:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by C.
