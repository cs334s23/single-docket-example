Due to the <br/>long waits in international adoption, the 171h expires before the adoption is <br/>completed and a 2nd fee has to be paid for the same adoption.  This is doubling <br/>the costs to parents.  If they won&#39;t extend the life of the 171h, please don&#39;t make <br/>us pay more.  We are already paying twice for the same approval and the second <br/>time is just an update.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a557", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-22T14:08:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-22T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T20:58:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by J Hamon", "trackingNbr": "8020a557", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0790/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0790/attachments"}}}}}
