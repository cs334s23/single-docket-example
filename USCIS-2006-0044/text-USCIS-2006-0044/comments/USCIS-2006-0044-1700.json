With the economies of shared information services, one would expect<br/>the price would actually decrease as the process becomes more automated and<br/>requires less human intervention.  We don&#39;t mind paying for what is needed, but<br/>are confused why the process seems to be taking longer, getting more complicated<br/>and expensive instead of the reverse. <br/><br/>We are adopting our second child internationally.  Not only did we have to<br/>replicate and pay for the entire I-600 A application process a second time with<br/>identical information, but it is possible that we will have to do a third time<br/>since our  I-171 status could potentially expire before our adoption is<br/>processed.  This seems inefficient.  <br/><br/>Couldn&#39;t the same data can be reused-- expediting the process and reducing the<br/>expense?  Perhaps there should be an exemption for international adoptions-- the<br/>expense of which is already excessive and presents a hardship to many otherwise<br/>well-intentioned families who only want to give a child a safe home.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration.   <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219eba", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:34:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:33:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Stefanie Sirc", "trackingNbr": "80219eba", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1700/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1700/attachments"}}}}}
