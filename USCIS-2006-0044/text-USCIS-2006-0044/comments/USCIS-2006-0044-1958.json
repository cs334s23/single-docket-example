This increase will affect not only new residents coming to America <br/>possibly forcing them to remain illegal aliens but will adversly affect the children <br/>who are being adopted internationally. <br/><br/> Adoption is expensive anyway.  The UCIS is the first large amount of money that <br/>a family faces.  This could be the one thing that would prevent a child from having <br/>a family in a country with the freedoms of the US.  <br/><br/>I deeply feel that the increase is not necessary and other means should be found <br/>to make up the financial difference.  I am just one small voice but I know there are <br/>many families in a precarious situation that may reach the end with increased <br/>fees.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b3cb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:09:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T15:04:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Beverly Moore", "trackingNbr": "8021b3cb", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1958/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1958/attachments"}}}}}
