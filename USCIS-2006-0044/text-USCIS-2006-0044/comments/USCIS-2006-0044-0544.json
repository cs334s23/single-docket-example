I would like to <br/>strongly suggest considering lowering the fees for those of us who have to redo our <br/>services within a certain time frame which is out of our control.  In my situation, <br/>my husband and I are adopting through The People&#39;s Republic of China and, due <br/>to the increasingly long wait time, we are forced to resubmit our petition and <br/>fingerprints.  It would be very appreciated if we had a lower fee the second time <br/>around since everything would remain the same for us.<br/>Thank you for your time<br/>Kisha Bishop<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207ff2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T20:03:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T02:16:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kisha Bishop", "trackingNbr": "80207ff2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0544/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0544/attachments"}}}}}
