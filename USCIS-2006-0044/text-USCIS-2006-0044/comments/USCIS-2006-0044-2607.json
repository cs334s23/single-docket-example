These increases are over 100% in many <br/>cases. None of us can ask for a 100% raise, and asking for this increase puts <br/>undue hardship on parents wishing to adopt and give loving homes to children.  It <br/>appears the goverment wishes to make more money off of these children&#39;s <br/>misfortune.  As adoptive parents often have to subumit a second I600-A and get <br/>refingerprinted due to increased international waits for adoption, this constitutes <br/>a &quot;double whammie&quot; anyway, without the additional rate increases. Please <br/>reconsider these outrageous rate increases.  Cost of living and inflation costs are <br/>understandible, but adding hundreds of dollars to each fee is excessive.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jennifer Smith<br/>adoptive mother<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dfa5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T01:55:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jennifer Smith", "trackingNbr": "8021dfa5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2607/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2607/attachments"}}}}}
