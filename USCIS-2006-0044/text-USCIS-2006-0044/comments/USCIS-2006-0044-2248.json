I am opposed to these increases.  I am in the midst <br/>of a foreign adoption.  The adoption wait time has dramatically increased since I <br/>began the process.  I have already received my approval from USCIS, however, I <br/>will most likely have to re-apply as the wait time in China is currently at 16 <br/>months from Log In date in China and the approval from USCIS is only valid for 18 <br/>months.   You do not offer an extension but force those in the waiting stage to re-<br/>apply and pay all the fees over again.  I feel we already pay DOUBLE the fees as <br/>most anyone trying to adopt from China will have to submit their paperwork &amp; fee <br/>to the USCIS TWICE!  I do not know the wait times in other countries but by <br/>increasing the fees, it is making the cost of adoption prohibitive.  We have no <br/>control over wait times, we have already received our approval.   Why make it so <br/>difficult and costly?  Most children in orphanages in other countries are innocent <br/>victims.  Wars, poverty and other dire circumstances put these children at risk.  <br/>We, as the United States of America, should stand up and help these children.  <br/>Let&#39;s not make it more difficult for families to help these children.  Let&#39;s not add to <br/>the cost.  Let&#39;s do something positive.  Instead of increasing the fees, why not <br/>offer to those who have already been approved an extension at a nominal fee!  <br/>Let&#39;s help the children and the families helping these children!
