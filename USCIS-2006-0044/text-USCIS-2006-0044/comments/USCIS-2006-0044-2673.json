I am a &#39;waiting&#39; <br/>adoptive parent, have paid the fees once, and am now facing having to pay them <br/>yet again, at the increased rate just to bring by baby home -- since the application <br/>is only good for 18 months and the process is currently taking more like 24+.  An <br/>extension fee, I could understand and likely agree with, but having to pay for them <br/>all over again, when I didn&#39;t even get reap any benefit from the first set of <br/>paperwork is absurd. <br/><br/>Please reconsider this fee increase, especially for those of us who have to re-<br/>submit the paperwork due to expiration of the original documents.
