Today the exact same form <br/>costs a prospective adoptive parent $545.  Biometric fingerprinting, which began in <br/>1998, has risen in cost from $25 to $70 per applicant.  For a two-parent family <br/>adopting a single child, the USCIS process costs an upward of $685.   <br/>Because of the instability concurrent with international adoption, many families <br/>find that their USCIS approval expires prior to their invitation to travel to their <br/>prospective child?s birth country.  As a result, many families (especially those <br/>adopting from China and Guatemala) find themselves repeating the entire <br/>immigration application two or three times.  This can increase the cost of an <br/>adoption by thousands of dollars  money many of us simply do not have. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing <br/>applications and with its customer service.  Processing throughout the regional <br/>offices is erratic  some I-600A applications take months to process, while <br/>individuals in other districts received approval of the exact same form within ten <br/>days.  The refusal of officials to give adoptive parents priority results in children <br/>languishing in orphanages or foster care overseas for months and months at a <br/>time.  Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers <br/>(I-140) and employment authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 and 1.97 <br/>months, respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned child (3.39 months).   <br/>There is no explanation for why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected <br/>859,543 I-765 and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A <br/>applicants.  <br/><br/>Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given greater scrutiny than <br/>adult foreign workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are met with deaf <br/>ears and directed to a status website which is not updated.  As a result of USCIS <br/>refusal to prioritize orphan petitions, thousands of children suffer needlessly.  <br/>There has been no move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive parents whose <br/>documents  expire  while they wait for their child?s home country to grant them <br/>approval to travel.  These parents are forced to reapply with USCIS, repaying the <br/>same exorbitant fees two and sometimes three additional times, each time <br/>subjecting themselves to the same long and uncertain wait for <br/>immigration approval.  If USCIS would simply extend the expiration deadline for <br/>the I-171H from eighteen months to three years, it would significantly reduce its <br/>workload without having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for what it needs, it is <br/>asking for what it wants.  It claims that this fee increase is designed to provide for <br/>an adequate and sustainable level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and <br/>processes designed to improve the USCIS ability to administer the nation?s <br/>immigration laws.  The Bureau justifies these increases by asserting that this fee <br/>rule would provide the necessary resources to maintain these processing time <br/>standards and fund further improvements to USCIS business operations to <br/>continue to reduce processing times while ensuring the <br/>appropriate level of security.<br/><br/>There are very few infants infiltrating Al-Qaeda.  The idea that adoptive parents are <br/>a threat to national security is laughable.  While we agree with the aims of the <br/>Department of Homeland Security, the additional levels of scrutiny on orphaned <br/>children and their prospective parents is absurd.  <br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud, <br/>improving service, changing benefit applications from paper to electronic means in <br/>order to streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to bear the burden of <br/>these goals is unconscionable.  Worse still, many of USCIS stated aims do not <br/>directly benefit those seeking to immigrate.   <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and are <br/>mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings to bring home a child.  <br/>Increasing the burden on us is not simply unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of <br/>waiting children.  We urge rejection of the current proposal and a new requirement <br/>that USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first priority to I-<br/>600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork required for orphan petitions, <br/>and extend the expiration of the I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Odile Buclez-Birsh<br/>311 West 105th street<br/>New York, NY 10025<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f09b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:06:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T21:38:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Odile Buclez-Birsh", "trackingNbr": "8021f09b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2854/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2854/attachments"}}}}}
