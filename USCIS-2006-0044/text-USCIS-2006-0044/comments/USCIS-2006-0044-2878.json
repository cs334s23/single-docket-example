We are currently in the process of adopting a baby girl <br/>from China and are &quot;like many&quot; on a very tight budget.  So many other things <br/>pertaining to adoption have increased as well and it has become a very expensive <br/>process. We have no regrets for starting the process but can only hope that <br/>someone will hear our voice and not continue with the rate increases at this time.  <br/>Thank you very much for taking the time to hear our comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ken &amp; Sharon Small  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f20f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:08:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-03T01:30:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ken and Sharon Small", "trackingNbr": "8021f20f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2878/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2878/attachments"}}}}}
