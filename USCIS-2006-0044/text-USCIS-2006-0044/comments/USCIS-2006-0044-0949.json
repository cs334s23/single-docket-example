The <br/>process is costly albeit well worth it! However, my sincere hope is that if the fee <br/>for the I-600A is raised, again, then it will remain in effect longer. It is incredibly <br/>difficult and trying to run out of time on the I-171H and have to begin a second <br/>time with additional fees. These children need a home and particulary with special <br/>needs children - they need to join their families as soon as possible. With <br/>government changes happening on both sides of the ocean at a regular pace, it is <br/>heartbreaking and needlessly stressful for parents and child/ren alike to be held <br/>up even longer in the adoption process. If a fee increase is warranted then I plead <br/>you to allow the approval to last up to a minimum of 24 months.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bc7a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T20:28:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T19:05:05Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tina Walrath", "trackingNbr": "8020bc7a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0949/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0949/attachments"}}}}}
