My family and I are in the midst of waiting for a referral from <br/>China and because of the overwhelming and wonderful demand of these children, <br/>we will unfortunately have to pay for various fees AGAIN from the USCIS.  This in <br/>and of itself is extremely frustrating and then to hear that the fees might increase <br/>creates even more frustration.  Adopting is so expensive and I don&#39;t feel that <br/>parents who want to adopt should be penalized for paying the already high fees, <br/>let alone pay even higher ones, should you choose to increase the price.  <br/>Everyone seems to want a piece of the pie in America for adoption when all the <br/>families want is their child.  Please consider what I have written and help my <br/>family and others, by not increasing the fees.
