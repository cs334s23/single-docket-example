Many people are already discouraged from <br/>adoption due to the costs and these increases could easily limit even more, those <br/>that are willing to go forward with the process.  Another issue is the fact that, in <br/>some cases, the adoption process is so lengthy, that individuals end up having to <br/>obtain and pay for some of these petitions twice.  Please consider leaving the <br/>costs for adoption-related petitions at their current prices.  You could make a <br/>difference in a child&#39;s life by helping to ease the financial burden of those <br/>considering adding a child to their family through adoption.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e32f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:35:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T14:05:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tish Rhodus", "trackingNbr": "8021e32f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2642/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2642/attachments"}}}}}
