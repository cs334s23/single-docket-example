Adoptive parents already have to come up with much money to adopt <br/>internationally and raising the  fees will  cause even  more undue financial burdens <br/>and hardship for those who wish to bring orphans overseas into the U. S. and  <br/>adoptive homes.<br/><br/>Adoptive parents should have support and be encouraged to adopt these waiting <br/>children and raising the fees will not help the children overseas to find loving, good <br/>homes as the expenses are astronomincally high enough  already. Adoption <br/>should be rewarded and those who adopt deserve a break to bring a child into their <br/>home to raise as their own, Adoption is a very admirable and noteworty act. Acts <br/>such as these should be supported, not made more difficult for the person who <br/>desires to build their families through adopting.
