They have to scrape up the money to meet the current fees. I do not have <br/>statistics but I have plenty of anecdotal evidence as I do data entry in an attorney&#39;s <br/>office and type the information they provide on forms. I do not have a conflict of <br/>interest because the attorney is my relative and I don&#39;t get paid. <br/><br/>In short, these increased fees will be a slap in the face to those who are trying to <br/>abide by the laws and do things accroding to procedures.<br/><br/>Please consider what you are doing to hard working people trying to abide by the <br/>law.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Christine Eheman<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f97a3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T19:02:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T17:37:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Christine Eheman", "trackingNbr": "801f97a3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0015/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0015/attachments"}}}}}
