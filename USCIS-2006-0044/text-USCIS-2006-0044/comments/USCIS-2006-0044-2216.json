The increases are outrageous.  The families pursuing adoption are <br/>already expected to invest so much financially not to mention emotionally.  We <br/>have already paid for the intial USCIS fee.  We have also paid to renew our USCIS <br/>fee due to an 18 month expiration period.    We have also paid to be fingerprinted <br/>twice, as required.  As an American Citizen, I want to help other families to avoid <br/>undue stress because of our own government regarding fees that seem <br/>unncessary.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Amy Docherty<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c00d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T02:33:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T15:47:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Amy Docherty", "trackingNbr": "8021c00d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2216/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2216/attachments"}}}}}
