It is a crime that you would jeopordize the well being of a young <br/>person by not giving them  he ability to be loved and cared for the way they should <br/>be.  My daughter and son in law have spent thousands trying to have a baby and <br/>since that can never be they have opted to adopt through China.  A small infant <br/>child that has no hope in this world will be given the opportunity to become <br/>whatever they decide to become.  There are many babies that grow up and never <br/>have a thing or the oportunity it is very sad.  Why would you want to raise fees, <br/>that would defray other worthy parents from being able to do what they want most <br/>in the world, have a child to care for and nurture. <br/><br/>Please rethink raising these fees, the government can find other ways to acquire <br/>money, don&#39;t make the small child be one of those ways.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b54e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:12:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T18:11:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Yvonne L.
