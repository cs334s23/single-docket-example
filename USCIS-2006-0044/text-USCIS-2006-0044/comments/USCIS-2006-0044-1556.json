The prolonged wait times means we will need to file <br/>for a second I-600A.  This $670 fee doesn&#39;t seem fair for families who have yet to <br/>bring home the child designated by the paperwork.  Perhaps there could be some <br/>sort of less expensive renewal fee for families that are still waiting.  Especially <br/>since this is more of an update to the I-600A.
