We understand that <br/>adjustment need to be made but as it is to adopt internationally a child is so <br/>difficult and expensive that an increase in fees could affect families that are trying <br/>to fullfill their dreams of becoming parents. The dreams of raising new citizens to <br/>our society that in the future will be the leaders and wil be part of the work force of <br/>our great nation. By adopting these children we are providing a better life for them <br/>in the best country of the world. Where we have freedom of speech, freedom to <br/>work and limitless opportunity for growth financially and professionally. Because <br/>we are realistic, we just want to request that you listen to our plea for a lower <br/>increase.<br/>Thank you for your time and attention.<br/>Sincerely;<br/>Vivian A.
