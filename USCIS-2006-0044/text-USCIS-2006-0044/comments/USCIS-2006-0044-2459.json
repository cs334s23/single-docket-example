There are many &quot;little&quot; charges here and <br/>there that add quickly to the 10&#39;s of thousands of dollars.  Many parents are also <br/>having to submit the I600 2 times based on the current expiration time period and <br/>having to be refingerprinted.  So the increase is HUGE when added to the current <br/>costs and then DOUBLED.  I fear that many children will not be brought home to <br/>their family because of this. this money is better invested in their educational <br/>future then on paperwork.<br/>Please reconsider this increase and consider increasing the time for these docs <br/>so they don&#39;t have to be redone.  This will save us ALL time and money.<br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d70b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:34:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T21:35:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Debra Paliani", "trackingNbr": "8021d70b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2459/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2459/attachments"}}}}}
