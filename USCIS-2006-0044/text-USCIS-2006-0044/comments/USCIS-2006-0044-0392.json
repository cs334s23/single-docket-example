In most cases, the proposed increases are<br/>double the current fees and would be beyond the ability to pay for most<br/>petitioners, many of whom are here as non-immigrants and have undertaken<br/>substantial costs to be in the U.S. in their current status. Many of these<br/>applications are for petitioners to apply for work authorization in their<br/>current status or to adjust their status to a category that will give them more<br/>employment opportunities. Making the fees prohibitively expensive for these<br/>petitioners defeats any economic benefit that they would gain by having their<br/>petitions approved. While we understand that fee increases are periodically<br/>necessary for USCIS to support its administrative costs, we feel that a steep<br/>increase in such a short amount of time is excessive. Incremental increases of<br/>5-10% per year is more reasonable and would allow petitioners sufficient time to<br/>prepare financially for these necessary expenses.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802063e7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-15T23:52:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T15:09:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Eric Cantor", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted Krittika Onsanit, University of Richmond", "trackingNbr": "802063e7", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0392/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0392/attachments"}}}}}
