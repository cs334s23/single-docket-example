These days it takes so long until you <br/>reach completion that we will have to refile several forms because they will expire.  <br/>Taking on an adoption is not easy for us financially to begin with, and having to <br/>redo forms when they expire is an extra charge on top of that.  For the fees on the <br/>I600A to go up will be an added hardship on us, and so many families.<br/>Thank you for your time, and I hopeit will be taken to heart....<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a119", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:15:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T03:42:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Heather Hester", "trackingNbr": "8020a119", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0764/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0764/attachments"}}}}}
