Fee increase <br/>won&#39;t give any relief to legal immigrants.<br/><br/>2) I applied for my GC in FY 2001 and still I am waiting to file my AOS. Reforms <br/>are required in each and every stage in legal immigration process.<br/><br/>3) For example, the new PERM process, premium I-140 &amp; premium H1-B are <br/>such reforms in the process. However they did more harm to the existing process <br/>than help.<br/><br/>4) I strongly oppose to allocate part of increase fee to asylum, refugee and certain <br/>other applicants. Such applicatns should have a separate process and Fed Govt <br/>must support &amp; fund that process. <br/><br/>5) Same as illegal immigrants. Fed Govt should build a new process for illegal <br/>immigrants. <br/><br/>6) Look at H1B/L1B workers tax contributions to US Govt. Despite huge <br/>contributions in all fronts, USCIS &amp; DHS give least perference to legal immigrants.<br/><br/>Once again, I oppose any fee increase to existing schedule.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Legal immigrant who lost faith on USCIS.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208cff", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:43:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T17:37:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "80208cff", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0677/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0677/attachments"}}}}}
