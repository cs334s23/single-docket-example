I find this proposal outrageous. An 86% <br/>increase in any fee is criminal.  The people who are paying these fees are here <br/>mostly due to poor financial status to begin with.  Please take in to consideration <br/>what you are asking for....  Are we trying to eliminate illigal immigration??  Well <br/>raising fees to a level that is unaffordable, will work to deter anyone from using the <br/>proper channels of immigration.  For the most part, these are hard working people <br/>just trying to earn an honest living.  They are making positive contributions to <br/>society.....  why then are we searching for ways to punish them and send them <br/>home??<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9d6b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T18:18:21Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T14:04:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Bernadette Maguire", "trackingNbr": "801f9d6b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0104/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0104/attachments"}}}}}
