Given the very long wait <br/>most parents endure for their child and the fact that fingerprints and needed <br/>immigration papers expire after 12-18 months, adoptive parents are forced to re-do <br/>many of their USCIS filings.  Since there is no &quot;renewal&quot; fee option, we are <br/>required to pay the full fees a second, or even third, time.  If the fee increase is <br/>approved, our cost will increase 140% for a second filing of the I600A form and <br/>new fingerprints alone.  I would ask that you consider lengthening the validity <br/>period for these forms once approval is granted or offering a reduced fee for <br/>renewals.  Please, do not place an unfair burden on adoptive parents.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Paula Davis    <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e41a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:37:22Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T17:18:50Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Paula Davis", "trackingNbr": "8021e41a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2659/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2659/attachments"}}}}}
