My daughter is from China.  I am sorry to hear that you are <br/>considering raising the costs associated with adoption.  Please reconsider this <br/>increase.  Adopting a child is a VERY costly undertaking, which unfortunately many <br/>people cannot afford.  Raising the fees will only make it more difficult and burdensome <br/>to accomplish.  The process of adoption from foreign countries is a long process, <br/>which is often prolonged by the foreign country, to last longer than your allotted time <br/>periods, which necessitates duplicate applications for your clearance.  Please do not <br/>make this process even more costly.  thank you for your consideration.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef8e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:33:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent, Rose Willette", "trackingNbr": "8021ef8e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2826/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2826/attachments"}}}}}
