I just recently <br/>reapplied for another I600 as the first expired after 18 months.   Most international <br/>adoptions can not be completed in that time frame and prospective adoptive <br/>parents have to apply and pay the full fee twice as opposed to a renewal fee.  The <br/>proposed fee twice is quite a deterrent to adoption.   After 7 years of infertlity <br/>treatment, we borrowed to be able to adopt and fulfill our dream of being parents.  <br/>The drastic increase in fees will limit that dream for many.   Please consider not <br/>raising the fees so high or having a cheaper renewal fee for the second time.  <br/><br/>Thanks<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021debf", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T22:23:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lauren Veit", "trackingNbr": "8021debf", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2589/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2589/attachments"}}}}}
