The average international adoption <br/>wait time has increased in length.  A lot of citizens have to go through some of <br/>these processes more than once.  For example, the I600A typically expires before <br/>the aoption even takes place.  Is it possible to think of a different process that <br/>would either make it last longer or if it expires a different rate for renewal?   Raising <br/>prices is not always the answer.
