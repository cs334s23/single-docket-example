I recommend <br/>that fees for adoption should not be changed.  Many adoptive parents have to file <br/>the I-600A TWICE because approval is only good for 18 months.  Having to pay <br/>the full price and file again substantially impacts the cost of adoption.  <br/><br/>A family looking to adopt currently has the following fees to anticipate:  <br/> I600A:  $545<br/>Fingerprints:  $70 x 2 = $140<br/>Total:    $685 (for many families, multiply by 2 for having to file twice)<br/><br/>What it will be now (assuming approval runs out and family must file twice) plus <br/>the increase:<br/> I600A:  $670 x 2 = $1340<br/> Fingerprints:  $80 x 4 =   $ 320<br/> Total:    $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 or over 140%!  That kind of an increase seems hard to <br/>justify, without an increase in services.  Where is that profit going to go?  <br/><br/>Additionally, adoptive families also will be impacted by the increase in the <br/>children&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) fee, which would change from <br/>$215 to $460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase.<br/><br/>Please rethink increasing these fees on behalf of adoptive families and all the <br/>ophans waiting for families.  Or, perhaps increase the amount of time the I600A <br/>approval is good for.  <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Jessica<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dda2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:07:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T18:58:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jessica Cunningham", "trackingNbr": "8021dda2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2562/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2562/attachments"}}}}}
