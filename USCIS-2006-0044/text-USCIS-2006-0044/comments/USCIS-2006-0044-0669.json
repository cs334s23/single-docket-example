The increase in prices , along with the <br/>fact that the green card process takes forever.. I say this because I am a legal <br/>immigrant and have been waiting and stuck in the green card process for more <br/>than 4 years. This makes people or companies less tempted to be in the united <br/>states and outsourcing will become more popular. The prices on H1 visa <br/>processing have increased and now this. It is probably more expensive than any <br/>other country that I know of and at the end of the day I wonder why to pay such a <br/>huge price , with no peace of mind as the process seems to be in a limbo.  I <br/>cannot change jobs, cannot take permanent offers and my family life suffers.With <br/>companies having to put so much money in H1 processing and green card , they <br/>might find outsourcing a better option. The company I worked for did not want to <br/>hire any people on H1 B and Green card and then after 6 years they had only <br/>consultants working which were people on H1 visas.

But if the costs of the visas keep increasing they <br/>might just decide to outsource the jobs to other countries where it is a lot <br/>cheaper. The process of outsourcing has already begun on a small scale and it <br/>has been working fine.Also folks like me , after spending around 7 years and still <br/>waiting to get a green card, and with all the uncertanities of how long the process <br/>will take find the process and the price raise exploiting.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802089da", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:42:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T15:49:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "802089da", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0669/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0669/attachments"}}}}}
