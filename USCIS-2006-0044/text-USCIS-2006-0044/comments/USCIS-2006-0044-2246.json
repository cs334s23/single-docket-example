The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services<br/>department is proposing a steep increase in adoption fees (per docket<br/>#USCIS-2006-0044).  I believe that a 66% increase of these fees is unfair and<br/>unjust.  I&#39;m commenting here to support that these fees NOT be raised at all or<br/>by a much lesser amount.  Adoption is already extremely expensive and such a<br/>steep raise in fees would keep more families from adopting who want and deserve<br/>to be parents.  It would also hurt the children of impoverished countries who<br/>deserve a chance at a better life.  I hope that all of our comments here matter<br/>and make a difference.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # ", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c4b3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:57:23Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T21:56:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Pat Obst", "trackingNbr": "8021c4b3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2246/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2246/attachments"}}}}}
