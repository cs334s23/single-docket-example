I submitted the paperwork to the Great Wall of <br/>China Adoption Agency which was received in China April 2005. At that time my <br/>husband and I planned to travel to China to adopt our little girl in a year.  Now, it is <br/>April 2006, and we have been told it will be another 16 months before we can <br/>adopt our little girl. We plan to name her  Alaina. <br/><br/>Prior to submitting our paperwork to China we had acquired and paid for the <br/>I600/600a and the fingerprinting as required.  Since these forms expire before we <br/>travel to adopt our baby we have to renew these forms.  This will cost us <br/>considerable more money which we did not budget for.<br/><br/>I have some concerns. First, I do not understand the reason for the time frame for <br/>the I600/600a and the fingerprints. It seems to me this is a duplication of time and <br/>money for which the goverment should not be wasting. Second, why do fingerpints <br/>need to be renewed?  Fingerprints don&#39;t change. Third, I don&#39;t believe I should be <br/>charged more by my government to adopt a child which I plan to raise as a <br/>productive, taxpaying citizen of the United States.<br/><br/>Please reconsider the price increase for the i600/600a, N565, N600, and the <br/>fingerprinting. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Jane Cavallaro  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e829", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T07:49:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jane Cavallaro", "trackingNbr": "8021e829", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2736/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2736/attachments"}}}}}
