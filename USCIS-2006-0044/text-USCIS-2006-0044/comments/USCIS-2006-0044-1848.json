The fees are already incredibly high and very difficult for <br/>middle class parents to afford.  I am also concerned to as why the fingerprints <br/>expire before the actual immigration approval?  We were forced to take yet <br/>another day off work and drive 2 hours ONE WAY to submit YET AGAIN our <br/>fingerprints and pay another $140 for this process.  We feel our own government is <br/>robbing us and we do not see why it is set up this way.  Even if you feel it is <br/>necessary to re-submit the fingerprints.  Why is it not possible to use the same <br/>prints we gave at the beginning to at least spare us from missing work and the <br/>gas expense to drive all that way?!!!  There is room for much improvement with the <br/>international adoption process in the United States.  The time it takes to receive <br/>your child&#39;s immigration approval is awful !!  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a78d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:54:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T15:45:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Nancy Boyda", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michelle R.
