There are so many factors to consider, including the safety of U.S. <br/>residents and the well-being of those seeking shelter in our country.  According to <br/>the DHS Immigration yearbook most immigrants come to the U.S. seeking to be <br/>with their family, for work, or as refugees or asylees.  If you couldn&#39;t provide for <br/>your family in your home country, what would you do?  If your child lived in the <br/>U.S. would you emmigrate from home to be with him or her?<br/><br/>If we want to know who is in our country, and if we want to live up to the invitation <br/>on the Statue of Liberty, &quot;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses <br/>yearning to breathe free&quot; then we need to make it more realistic for immigrants to <br/>be legal.  An increase in fees does NOT make it easier for law-abiding, hard-<br/>working human beings to do so.  The money can come from somewhere else, <br/>from a source that is more capable of paying.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020eebf", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T17:39:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-07T21:18:44Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Audrey N.
