That means people often have to re-apply (and be <br/>fingerprinted again), which means they must pay these fees twice. Given all of the <br/>other expenses for adoption, this just increases the financial burden on families.<br/><br/>A possible solution that would resolve higher processing costs is to increase the <br/>time an I-600 and associated fingerprint records are valid. This would reduce the <br/>number of families reapplying after their documents have expired. It would have the <br/>added benefit of effectively reducing costs for adoptive parents as they will not be <br/>forced to pay the current fees ($545 + $70/adult family member) twice.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention in this matter.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020c26f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-28T15:55:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-28T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-27T21:21:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8020c26f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0970/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0970/attachments"}}}}}
