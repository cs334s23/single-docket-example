USCIS should look to the<br/>U.S. Congress to adequately fund the agency and not penalize working families<br/>for the complete failure of the U.S. Government to address the numerous<br/>shortcomings of the agency.  Such an excessive fee increase as the one currently<br/>proposed serves only to further divide families and prevent individuals from<br/>remaining in, or coming to, the United States with a legal status.  Your<br/>proposal will only exacerbate an already enormous immigration crisis that<br/>continues to divide our country.  Request funding for your &quot;improvements&quot; from<br/>Congress - where almost all other government agencies receive their funding.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480205228", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-14T18:33:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-14T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-13T20:15:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Regina Jefferies", "trackingNbr": "80205228", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0352/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0352/attachments"}}}}}
