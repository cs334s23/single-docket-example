We are going through an adoption <br/>which is going to take a while and we will probably have to reapply before the end <br/>of the adoption because of only an 18month validity.  If you raise the fee it will add <br/>more expenses to our adoption and many others.  We want our children to come <br/>home soon and to not have even more added stress of higher fees.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b88a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T23:44:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T02:22:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Richard Baker", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tricia Stringer", "trackingNbr": "8021b88a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2078/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2078/attachments"}}}}}
