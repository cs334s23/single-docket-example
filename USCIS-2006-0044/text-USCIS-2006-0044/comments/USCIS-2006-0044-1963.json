Today the exact same form<br/>costs a prospective adoptive parent $545.  Biometric fingerprinting, which began<br/>in 1998, has risen in cost from $25 to $70 per applicant.  For a two-parent<br/>family adopting a single child, the USCIS process costs an upward of $685.  <br/>Because of the instability concurrent with international adoption, many families<br/>find that their USCIS approval expires prior to their invitation to travel to<br/>their prospective child?s birth country.  As a result, many families (especially<br/>those adopting from China and Guatemala) find themselves repeating the entire<br/>immigration application two or three times.  This can increase the cost of an<br/>adoption by thousands of dollars ? money many of us simply do not have. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing<br/>applications and with its customer service.  Processing throughout the regional<br/>offices is erratic ? some I-600A applications take months to process, while<br/>individuals in other districts received approval of the exact same form within<br/>ten days.  The refusal of officials to give adoptive parents priority results in<br/>children languishing in orphanages or foster care overseas for months and months<br/>at a time.  Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers<br/>(I-140) and employment authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 and 1.97<br/>months, respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned child (3.39 months). <br/> There is no explanation for why USCIS finds it possible to process the<br/>projected 859,543 I-765 and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260<br/>I-600/600A applicants.  Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given<br/>greater scrutiny than adult foreign workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are met with<br/>deaf ears and directed to a ?status? website which is not updated.  As a result<br/>of USCIS? refusal to prioritize orphan petitions, thousands of children suffer<br/>needlessly.  There has been no move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive<br/>parents whose documents ?expire? while they wait for their child?s home country<br/>to grant them approval to travel.  These parents are forced to reapply with<br/>USCIS, repaying the same exorbitant fees two and sometimes three additional<br/>times, each time subjecting themselves to the same long and uncertain wait for<br/>immigration approval.  If USCIS would simply extend the ?expiration? deadline<br/>for the I-171H from eighteen months to three years, it would significantly<br/>reduce its workload without having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for what it needs,<br/>it is asking for what it wants.  It claims that this fee increase ?is designed<br/>to provide for an adequate and sustainable level of investment in staff, in<br/>infrastructure, and processes designed to improve the USCIS? ability to<br/>administer the nation?s immigration laws.?  The Bureau justifies these increases<br/>by asserting that ?this fee rule would provide the necessary resources to<br/>maintain these processing time standards and fund further improvements to USCIS<br/>business operations to continue to reduce processing times while ensuring the<br/>appropriate level of security.?<br/><br/>There are very few infants infiltrating Al-Qaeda.  The idea that adoptive<br/>parents are a threat to national security is laughable.  While we agree with the<br/>aims of the Department of Homeland Security, the additional levels of scrutiny<br/>on orphaned children and their prospective parents is absurd.  <br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud,<br/>improving service, changing benefit applications from paper to electronic means<br/>in order to streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to bear the burden<br/>of these goals is unconscionable.  Worse still, many of USCIS? stated aims do<br/>not directly benefit those seeking to immigrate.  <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and are<br/>mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings to bring home a child. <br/>Increasing the burden on us is not simply unfair, it is detrimental to the lives<br/>of waiting children.  We urge rejection of the current proposal and a new<br/>requirement that USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first<br/>priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork required for<br/>orphan petitions, and extend the ?expiration? of the I-171H from eighteen months<br/>to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Jennifer Bryson<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021abfe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:09:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T01:32:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jennifer Bryson", "trackingNbr": "8021abfe", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1963/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1963/attachments"}}}}}
