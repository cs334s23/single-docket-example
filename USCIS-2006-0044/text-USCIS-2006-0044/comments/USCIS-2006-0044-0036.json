The increases suggested in this <br/>regulation are very high and will make it hard for most of the people to apply thus <br/>losing rights to be the Citizens of the greatest country on earth. I suggest the <br/>increase is not more than 25% if there has to be one and the backlog reduced to <br/>a max of a few months and eventually no backlog by 2009. If USCIS is self <br/>supporting organization, that is great but it should know that it is the only <br/>organization not only in the US but I will bet throughtout the world to have <br/>backlogs of years to process applications. Increases in fee for better and faster <br/>service will have everyones support. Therefore, I am against the fee increases. <br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Aurangzeb<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f98b7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T20:00:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T19:50:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Aurangzeb A.
