It is not uncommon for wait times <br/>to reach or exceed 24 months before our adoption is complete.  This timeframe <br/>forces many adoptive parents to reapply for the I-600A twice, and now in some <br/>cases three times.  This represents a significant and unnecessary financial <br/>hardship for many potential adoptive families (including ours).  International <br/>adoption is an extremely expensive and time consuming process.  The potential <br/>for increased the fees for waiting families represents an additional undue hardship <br/>with no clear definition as to how the increase would help decrease the cost or <br/>time to adopt a waiting child.<br/><br/>We would respectfully ask that any bill passed exclude or waive any fee increases <br/>applicable to adoption related activities (both international and domestic).<br/><br/>Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021bf53", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T02:32:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T15:09:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by James Henderson", "trackingNbr": "8021bf53", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2210/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2210/attachments"}}}}}
