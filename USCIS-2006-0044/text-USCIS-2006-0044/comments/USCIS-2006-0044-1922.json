Due to the increased wait time I have to had redo my I-171 for an <br/>extension, resulting in double the fees. While no one wants to pay the the pricey <br/>fee amounts, it is extremely frustrating that our government places expiration <br/>dates on fingerprints and I-171, both of which are necessary for me to bring my <br/>future daughter home. Like other parents, we had to have our home study <br/>completed before we could apply for our I-171. In the beginning we thought we <br/>would have had a 6-8 month wait but shortly after we were logged in, the wait <br/>began to extend. Due to the fact that most countries are taking longer to process <br/>adoptions, I think it only fair that our own govt extend the expiration dates on <br/>documents. I think to increase the fees to the proposed amounts is also adding <br/>insult to injury since it also takes so long to get documents processed. Maybe <br/>with these additional fees you can hire more personnel to staff your offices.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aacd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:57:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T21:54:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kimberly B.
