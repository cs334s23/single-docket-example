Many families, including ours have saved for <br/>years for our adoptions.  And raising the fees, will just make it more difficult to <br/>afford adoption.   And ultimately less families will be able to adopt and more <br/>children will be left without parents, which would be a shame. Please do not raise <br/>the fees.
