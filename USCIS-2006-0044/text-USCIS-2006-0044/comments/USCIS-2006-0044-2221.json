Today the exact same<br/>form costs a prospective adoptive parent $545. Biometric fingerprinting,<br/>which began in 1998, has risen in cost from $25 to $70 per applicant. For a<br/>two-parent family adopting a single child, the USCIS process costs an upward<br/>of $685. Because of the instability concurrent with international<br/>adoption, many families find that their USCIS approval expires prior to<br/>their invitation to travel to their prospective child?s birth country. As a<br/>result, many families (especially those adopting from China and Guatemala)<br/>find themselves repeating the entire immigration application two or three<br/>times. This can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars ?<br/>money many of us simply do not have. <br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud,<br/>improving service, changing benefit applications from paper to electronic<br/>means in order to streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to bear<br/>the burden of these goals is unconscionable. Worse still, many of USCIS?<br/>stated aims do not directly benefit those seeking to immigrate. <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and<br/>are mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings to bring home a<br/>child. Increasing the burden on us is detrimental<br/>to the lives of waiting children. We urge rejection of the current proposal<br/>and a new requirement that USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families,<br/>give first priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork<br/>required for orphan petitions, and extend the ?expiration? of the I-171H<br/>from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c15b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:45:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T17:00:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Erik Halls ", "trackingNbr": "8021c15b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2221/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2221/attachments"}}}}}
