My fear is that, if approved, this will deter more <br/>people from trying to immigrate legally.  More people will &quot;sneak&quot; across borders <br/>(whether on their own, or brought here by U.S. citizen employers) because they <br/>won&#39;t be able to afford the process.  In turn, this will breed more xenophobia (like <br/>some displayed on this comment board) and fewer solutions to what is clearly a <br/>problem.  What will happen with the helpless who have no where else to turn--will <br/>we just turn them away?  <br/><br/>Only the truly fortunate (i.e. those of us who are already here) have the luxury of <br/>criticizing the poor for wanting to make a better world (i.e. by immigrating to our <br/>wonderful country) for themselves and their families.  I am glad that there are so <br/>many fortunate people here in this country, but I am ashamed at how they turn <br/>their backs on those who need us most.  I would encourage them to actually learn <br/>about the immigration process, rather than comment out of ignorance.  Please, <br/>realize that just because someone new comes to this country doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>they&#39;re a bad person who only steals and lives on welfare.  Remember, the <br/>majority of us here are here because our ancestors were once immigrants.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f987c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T19:29:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T19:12:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801f987c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0029/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0029/attachments"}}}}}
