In particular, we <br/>are orking with the China program.  I believe that the U.S. government, with its tax <br/>credit, attempts to support the adoption process and the moral commitment a <br/>society has to support orphane children.  I applaud their effort.  My husband and I <br/>happen to be in the rare circumstance to be able to afford this increase.  Most of <br/>the wonderful people that we have met along our adoption journey would find this <br/>to be a real hardship.  They have already made so many concession and borrowed <br/>from family and friends to fulfill their dream.  An approximate $1,000 increase just <br/>may keep a lot of these lonving couples/individuals from adopting.  Thank you for <br/>your consideration in this matter.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e779", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T04:25:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jane John", "trackingNbr": "8021e779", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2725/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2725/attachments"}}}}}
