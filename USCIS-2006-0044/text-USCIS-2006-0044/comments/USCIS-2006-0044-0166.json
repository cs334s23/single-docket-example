This country was glad <br/>to have the immigrants when it needed them to build, for railroads etc.<br/><br/>I understand that the government has decided that the process of filing to become <br/>a legal citizen has to be paid for.  But if the filing fees are increased beyond the <br/>reach of the majority of immigrants wishing to apply, then the vast majority will <br/>remain here illegally, until, or if, they are caught and deported.<br/><br/>There are illegal immigrants in this country using what appear to be legitimate <br/>documentation they have bought for anything from $500 - $1500, these are one off <br/>payments.<br/><br/>In Europe you do not have to pay to file and register to work, unless you employ <br/>an attorney, or have an unusual circumstance.<br/><br/>Instead of not allowing them to work, they should be encouraged to find work and <br/>maybe an attachment could be applied to their wages to repay the cost of the <br/>process.<br/><br/>As for benefits they could be excluded from claiming them until such time as they <br/>had paid in enough contributions to the system.  This is something I personally <br/>think should apply to everyone not just immigrants.<br/><br/>Also they should be obliged to sign to say that if they do not follow the laws of the <br/>land and find themselves with a criminal conviction that this will lead to their <br/>immediate deportation.<br/><br/>This is just another opinion.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa398", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T16:40:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-04T17:24:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Elizabeth Allen", "trackingNbr": "801fa398", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0166/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0166/attachments"}}}}}
