We are part of the adoption <br/>community waiting to be matched with our daughter.  These fees would place an <br/>extreme burden on us as well as many adoptive parents.  We are tax paying <br/>citizens and our adopted daughter will be covered by our insurance and will not <br/>put an added burden on the system.  There needs to be consideration for those <br/>adoptive families.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e2d2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:53:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T12:55:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021e2d2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2633/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2633/attachments"}}}}}
