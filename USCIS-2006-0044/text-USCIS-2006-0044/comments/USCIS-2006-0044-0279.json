I am still surprised to see such as large jump of <br/>application fee, specially I-485. For a middle class employed by big corporation, <br/>one time application fee increase is unlikely to impact the living standard. But <br/>since many of immigrates are from third-world country, $905 application might be <br/>worth one year of their family income. That burden is too much. My opinion is: If <br/>we have to adjust the fee structure, we should do it in phased period and should <br/>allow certain hardship application.
