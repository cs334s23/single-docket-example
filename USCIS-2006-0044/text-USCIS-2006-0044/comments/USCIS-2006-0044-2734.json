The fees for the I-600 have increased significantly in the past  10 <br/>years.  These fee increases should be sufficient to cover the costs associated <br/>with the processing of the I-600.  If the USCIS is looking to increase funds in <br/>general, then they should look toward increasing fees for other services and keep <br/>the fees needed to process the I-600 stable.  <br/><br/>These increases do nothing for prospective parents but add to the stress and <br/>burden that we are going through to create our families.  Seek other ways to raise <br/>money for your agency.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e7db", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T06:21:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Alexa Knight", "trackingNbr": "8021e7db", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2734/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2734/attachments"}}}}}
