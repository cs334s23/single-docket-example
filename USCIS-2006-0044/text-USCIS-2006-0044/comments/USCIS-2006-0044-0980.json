My husband and I have already received our I-171H form for our foreign <br/>adoption. Due to the significantly increased wait in adoption of children from <br/>China, we will have to refile our I-600A to the USCIS for updated fingerprinting and <br/>forms. The proposed fee increases will result in an additional cost of $155 to us. <br/>However, this is in addition to the costs we will incur already in having to have <br/>these same forms redone. We are writing to respectfully request that the <br/>proposed fee increases not be enacted. Please consider that we are already <br/>paying considerable amounts of money to complete our adoption, and this poses <br/>a significant, additional burden. <br/><br/>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to participate,<br/><br/>Cindy Brown<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020c6c0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-01T21:15:23Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-28T20:53:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cindy M Brown", "trackingNbr": "8020c6c0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0980/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0980/attachments"}}}}}
