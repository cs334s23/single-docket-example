China has slowed down their process so much.  There are<br/>thousands of couples who will have their fingerprints and I600A&#39;s expire before<br/>we can even use them.  This is a financial burden to many.  Not to mention the<br/>additional time it will take us and your department to process the additional<br/>paperwork.  It will cost us over $1,000.00 to renew all the necessary paperwork<br/>as it is.  With this proposed fee increase, this will add even more of a burden<br/>financially to thousands.  We ask that you reconsider this fee increase.  It<br/>doesn&#39;t make sense to thousands that we will have pay AGAIN for paperwork when<br/>it hasn&#39;t even been used.<br/>Thank you for your time and we pray that you will reconsider this fee increase.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802091b5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:44:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T22:18:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tammy L.
