They are already having to pay so <br/>much to &quot;purchase&quot; a child and wait so long. If you are going to need to increse <br/>the amount of money people have to put out to adopt, at least make it effective <br/>after a certain date. Those that are already going through the process should not <br/>have to pay the extra amount. If anything it should be new people just getting <br/>started in the adoption process.(ex. if cut off date is Feb. 28,2007, anyone already <br/>in the process before that date should NOT be affected by the increase, those <br/>after the date will have to pay the higher amount.) It would be better for all those <br/>wanting or needing to adopt to NOT increase the amount they have to pay to <br/>adopt a child from another country. They just want to start or add to their family. <br/>Does importance of family mean nothing to this country anymore? Why are <br/>children having to be bought in the first place? It&#39;s not like merchandise that you <br/>buy of a rack or shelf at a retail store. These are human beings. These children <br/>that are being adopted from other countries are given a better life, if you make the <br/>people who want to adopt spend all their money on the adoption process, you&#39;re <br/>also taking away from that child. The adoptive parents may not be as finacially <br/>stable if you keep making them pay more. Less people won&#39;t be able to adopt and <br/>those suffering children in other countries will suffer even more. All of mankind <br/>would hurt from your increase. A child is to be LOVED, not bought.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208916", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T20:26:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T14:24:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Elizabeth Wong", "trackingNbr": "80208916", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0658/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0658/attachments"}}}}}
