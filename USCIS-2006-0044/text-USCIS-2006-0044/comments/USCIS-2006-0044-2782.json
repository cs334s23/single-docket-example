I have also endured the long waiting time for governments <br/>of both countrys to approve application, approve paperwork, etc.  This process is <br/>not easy, far from it, but could be made easier if the expense was not so great.  <br/>Now, there is a proposed fee increase.  This is ridiculous!  Unless you plan to <br/>increase employment which will make our waiting time for approval MUCH shorter, <br/>there should not be a fee increase.  Consider what you are doing!  This is a step <br/>that MANY parents much go through twice, due to the fact that international <br/>adoptions are taking longer and expiring 171Hs.  It is completely unfair to us all!!  If <br/>you must increase the fee (which I know you don&#39;t, but I&#39;m willing to give the <br/>benefit of the doubt), make sure that this part of our process will speed up....speed <br/>up by a great deal of time!<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021edde", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T16:43:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Terry Bracey", "trackingNbr": "8021edde", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2782/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2782/attachments"}}}}}
