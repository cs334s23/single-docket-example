International adoption is a wonderful opportunity for <br/>many children who otherwise might not have the opportunity for a good life in the <br/>United States.  I understand from families that I have meant that adoption is a very <br/>expensive process be it in the United States or internationally.  It is very sad that <br/>the fees continually have to be raised as this creates financial difficulties on the <br/>adopting parents that could otherwise be monies well spent on the adopted <br/>children going to these families.  Please do not continue to raise the various fees <br/>that are involved in the adoption process.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020af58", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T14:56:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-23T22:25:42Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8020af58", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0922/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0922/attachments"}}}}}
