As a family currently in the process <br/>of international adoption, we find the financial challenges to be one of the greatest impediments to <br/>adopting a child.  Further increases in filing fees will only make these costs even more prohibitive to <br/>families who would like to adopt a child internationally.  I hope you will take families like ours into <br/>consideration and choose not to raise the USCIS filing fees.<br/><br/>I am glad that our country gives us opportunities like this, so that our voices may be heard by the <br/>decision-makers.  Thank you for reading my comments and carefully weighing this decision!  <br/><br/>Erica E.
