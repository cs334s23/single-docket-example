My wife and I are in the process of adopting our second child from China. <br/>With our first, the wait for a match took about 7 1/2 months. Current time frames are closing in on <br/>20 months, meaning that we would need to resubmit the I-600A application and fingerprints, and <br/>pay an increase as well, because the current fingerprints are good for only 18 months. On top of <br/>the $685 already paid, this would add another $830, for a total exceeding $1,500. For those of us <br/>who lack the financial resources of a Madonna or Angelina Jolie, this proposed increase is very <br/>disturbing. Many families make financial sacrifices to make the world a little better for a child who <br/>would otherwise not have a family.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e835", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T08:07:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kenneth Felsher", "trackingNbr": "8021e835", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2737/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2737/attachments"}}}}}
