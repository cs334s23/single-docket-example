With the cost of Adoption being over $30,000 many families who want <br/>to adopt a waiting child DON&#39;T. These increases are not needed $545 for the I-600 <br/>form a simple piece of paper. We paid $140 for fingerprinting and had to drive to <br/>Buffalo, that same day we went to our local police station to have fingerprinting <br/>done for the FBI &amp; the cost was only $15 for the same exact printing process so <br/>why the need to raise the cost to $80 ???? We have taken out several loans <br/>upped the limit on our credit cards and work overtime every day and weekend <br/>hoping Praying that we&#39;ll have enough money to make our dream of Adopting a <br/>child become reality. Instead of raising the cost how about offering Adoptive <br/>families grants and low interest loans to make it easier for families wanting to <br/>adopt. <br/>Raising these cost will only cause problems in the process of Adopting and turn <br/>away many who want to but can&#39;t afford to adopt.<br/>Somewhere a Child Sits and Waits. <br/>Please do the right thing &quot;NO INCREASES IN THESE COST&quot;<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ac1f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:10:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T01:47:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Children's hope International", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Brian M.
