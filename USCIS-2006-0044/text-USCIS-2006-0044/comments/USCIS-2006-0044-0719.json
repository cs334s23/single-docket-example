These applicants <br/>have  already paid a lot to renew APs and EADs every year. For example, my <br/>family have 4 EADs and about 3 APs for each member. These cost us over $2000 <br/>in total! I don&#39;t think we should be asked to pay for these interim benefits anymore <br/>if the AOS applications continue to be delayed by background checks.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802094a3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:46:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-18T07:14:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "802094a3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0719/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0719/attachments"}}}}}
