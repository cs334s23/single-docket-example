We have seen such a increase of fees in the last several year, <br/>increases that cannot be explained. The increases are above and beyond what <br/>would be considered normal increases.  As it is many parents of children adopted <br/>before the first recent increase as couple years ago cannot even afford to get their <br/>childs Cerificate of citizenship, now the increase is even higher.<br/>I hope you  will consider how these extravagant increases will effect many families <br/>whose dream of having chidlren may be hindered due to the increase in all these <br/>fees. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a6b7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T18:42:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T14:20:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Patricia M.
