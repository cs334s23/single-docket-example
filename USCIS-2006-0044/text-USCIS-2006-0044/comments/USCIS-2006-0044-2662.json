Since fee <br/>increases are already high enough , you should increase  to 3 years the time this <br/>legal paperwork will be in effect Adoptions are taking much longer than previously. <br/>More children than ever are in need of loving families. We can have a positive <br/>impact on those less fortunate. <br/><br/>Increasing the fees could prevent some middle class families from being able to <br/>adopt an orphan.
