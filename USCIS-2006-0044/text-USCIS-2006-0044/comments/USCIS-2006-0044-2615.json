As an adoptive mother,  I am writing to ask that you<br/>please not raise the fees, specifically for  processing the I-600A form/Petition<br/>to Classify an Orphan.  International adoption is difficult enough as it<br/>is-emotionally and financially.  We want to bring our children home!  But this<br/>is one more road block to making this happen if the fees are increased.   For<br/>many, adoption is the only way to have a family.    Due to the politics in other<br/>countries, re-accredidiation in Russia for example, many families (including us)<br/>have had to re-apply for the form as it was about to expire.  So, we had to pay<br/>$545, twice-not something we planned on.  <br/><br/>The Spirit of Adoption has captured our hearts and led us to another country. <br/>Please don&#39;t add additional fees to the already difficult task of bringing these<br/>children home. Thank you in advance for hearing our concerns!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Adoptive Mom to one cute Russian Prince and paperchasing for our Polish Princess<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e011", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:05:01Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T03:06:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021e011", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2615/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2615/attachments"}}}}}
