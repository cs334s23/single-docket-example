Costs for adoption are so expensive and these added increases with <br/>the increase in wait times would cause undue hardship on families that so <br/>desperately want to create a family through adoption. Unfortunately the forms <br/>expire in 15/18 months and due to the ever increasing wait times it causes <br/>families to have to redo these forms and pay again. My family has already paid <br/>these fees twice and may have to pay them a third time. Maybe if you have to <br/>increase the fees then you could make it so the form doesn&#39;t expire and have to be <br/>redone with added fees. One other suggestion would be that the government would <br/>allow us to deduct all of our adoption expenses instead of being limited to the <br/>almost $11,000 as most adoptions cost between $16,000-$30,000.<br/>I would hope that you would not increase the fees but if you do please consider <br/>the options given above.  We all want the same things- helping to bring families <br/>together through adoption.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de71", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T21:14:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Angela", "trackingNbr": "8021de71", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2583/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2583/attachments"}}}}}
