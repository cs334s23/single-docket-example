As an adoptive family waiting for our child,<br/>we feel that the increase puts an unfair burden on waiting families who have<br/>already paid the complete set of fees one time and now face a second set of<br/>fees.  The Memphis TN office that we have to use is not very efficient<br/>currently.  The idea of us, and other citizens of our country, paying more money<br/>for such poor service is not a good one.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Charity E.
