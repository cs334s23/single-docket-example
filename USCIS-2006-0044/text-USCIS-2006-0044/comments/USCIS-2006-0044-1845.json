These proposed fees will more than erase any tax-credit increase <br/>touted by the IRS.  I suggest that you increase all your expiration dates as most <br/>foreign adoptions now are taking over 1.5 years to complete and these fees are <br/>required YET AGAIN!  My fingerprints have not changed from 15 months ago, why <br/>do I need to have them taken YET AGAIN?  Sorry to vent here but it is really <br/>frustrating to go through this process and see that this increase fee proposal has <br/>been open to comments since the first of February and just now hear of it.....I am <br/>sure you would get a lot more comments if this increase were announced like the <br/>recent postage stamp increase.  Please do not raise these fees, they are too high <br/>now, especially when we are paying for them twice....<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a89d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:53:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:33:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Matt M.
