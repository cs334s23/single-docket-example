We have <br/>long read about legislation to try to extend the time period with which our USCIS <br/>I-171H and fingerprints would be valid for while we were in the &quot;waiting period&quot; for <br/>our match with a child.  Not only has that legislation not moved at all during the <br/>last 14 months that we have been tracking it, now I am learning that not only am I <br/>going to have to re-pay to have the exact same service provided due to your <br/>inadequate expiration dates, but now I am going to have to possibly pay even <br/>more!  I understand these fees are proposed to go to:<br/><br/>N-600 fee will go from $255 to $420 <br/>*I-600A Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative fee will go from $545 <br/>to $670 <br/>*N-565 Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship (used for name <br/>changes) will go from $220 to$380<br/>*Biometric Services (fingerprints) will go from $70 per person to $80 per person<br/><br/>Why can&#39;t you find a way to set up a different set of rules that HELP people who <br/>are trying to help a child through an international adoption versus taking more <br/>money from us?!  We are all spending tens of thousands of dollars for the right <br/>and priviledge to serve as parents to these very needy children and for many this <br/>is a financial challenge to do so.  Increases in the fees and choosing not to pass <br/>legislature to extend the expiration date on these previously completed processes <br/>only hurts the children who we all so desperately want to help.<br/><br/>Please reconsider or consider a way to ammend the proposal to accomodate <br/>those families who are in the middle of an international adoption?<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Vince &amp; Kara Ranieri<br/>Zionsville, Indiana<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c6c9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:01:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T02:42:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Vincent Ranieri", "trackingNbr": "8021c6c9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2262/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2262/attachments"}}}}}
