First, I <br/>think it&#39;s going to have the obvious effect of discouraging people (who don&#39;t have a <br/>lot of money) from filing. I think we should be encouraging the 12 million people <br/>here illegally to emerge from the shadows and make themselves legal, not <br/>discouraging them. Secondly, I seriously doubt that this is the best way to <br/>acheive the stated goal of eliminating backlogs. If they want to eliminate backlogs <br/>so bad, why is USCIS firing numerous adjudicators? When has any fee increase <br/>ever eliminated the backlog, like they always say it will? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I <br/>think 95% of the people that work at USCIS are doing their job well. But if you <br/>really want to eliminate backlog, stop hiring people at the Service Centers on a <br/>contract, temporary basis for close to minimun wage.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9adb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:56:20Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T04:06:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michael J.
