This proposed increase looks like a punishment for <br/>any law abiding person who wants to settle in the USA!!!  If indeed an increase is <br/>needed... it would make more sense to be around the normal inflation not 80%.  If <br/>an extra funding is still needed... USCIS should seek it from the federal <br/>government not from the poor new settlers who have so many costs to take care <br/>of.<br/><br/>I also oppose some of the re-structuring proposed.  Having I-485 include both <br/>Advanced Parole and Work Authorization would mean unneeded extra costs for <br/>people already with a valid work visa.  What about dependants?  What is work <br/>Authorization good for a 10 years old kid!!<br/><br/>Please please re-consider your proposal ... the increase for I-485 would mean a <br/>huge burden for even a small family of 4 people.  The new cost would be $3620 <br/>that is an increase of $2320 .. is that really reasonable?<br/><br/>Thanks for listening...<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e793", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T04:49:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021e793", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2727/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2727/attachments"}}}}}
