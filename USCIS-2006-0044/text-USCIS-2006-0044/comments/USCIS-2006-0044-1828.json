My wife and I are currently in the process of adopting a <br/>child from China. We have already had to pay these fees once so far in the <br/>process and could have to pay them another 1-2 times depending on how long the <br/>process takes to be finalized.  Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to increase the I-<br/>171H validity to 30-36 months so that we (adopting parents) wouldn&#39;t have <br/>bombard your agency with new requests?   <br/>I believe that the government should be aiding us to bring our children home rather <br/>than becoming another hinderance in the long road to adoption.  We already face <br/>so many hurdles when it comes to adoption, why would you want to throw another <br/>emotional and financial one for us to get past?<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a6a6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T18:42:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T14:14:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By James M Prestenberg", "trackingNbr": "8021a6a6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1828/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1828/attachments"}}}}}
