Due to the <br/>current increasing wait times of child referral, our form I-171H will expire and need <br/>to be renewed prior to travel to China. Adoption isn&#39;t a cheap endeaver, having to <br/>pay the fees twice is already a burden but to have a rate increase only further <br/>increases that financial burden.  Would it not be more prudent to extend the <br/>expiration date on the I-171H and fingerprints so that the already overworked <br/>government employees don&#39;t have repetitive and redundant work to do?e<br/>Please take those of us adopting with 17-18 month referral wait lines in <br/>consideration and extend the expiration date instead of making us pay over twice <br/>the amount of everyone else.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207eb0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T19:32:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T22:57:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Amy R.
