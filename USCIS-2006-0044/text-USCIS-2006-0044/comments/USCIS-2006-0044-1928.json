Of specific interest to me is the <br/>proposed increase in the I-600A fee and the fee for fingerprints. My wife and I are <br/>trying to adopt internationally, and the expense is already prohibitive enough <br/>without the added expense of the proposed fee increase. I know many other <br/>families that are in the adoption process feel the same way. If a fee increase is <br/>imminent, at least consider the idea of grandfathering I-600A application and <br/>fingerprint fees that have already been submitted and logged in prior to the fee <br/>increase. To ask for extra fees from people that have already submitted fees under <br/>the current fee structure is not acceptable.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aaff", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:57:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T22:33:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Howard Coble", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Brian K.
