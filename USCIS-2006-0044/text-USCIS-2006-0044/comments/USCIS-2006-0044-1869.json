Raising the price of these needed forms<br/>will price adoption out of the average family. <br/>We are currently in the process of adopting, the cost has been a great burden on<br/>our family. Due to infertility we have no other means of adding to our family.<br/>Also due to previous treatments and the financial, physical and emotional toll<br/>these things have taken already, our family has been experiencing a lot of<br/>hardship. Please do not raise any fees associated with adoption, in fact I<br/>believe you should drop them. Or streamline them, this is the 21st century, with<br/>computers and national/international databases things should be getting simpler<br/>and less expensive NOT more time consuming and expensive. <br/>I find docket number USCIS-2006- 0044 to be an affront to the american family<br/>and to orphaned children. This clearly takes advantage of all parties involved<br/>in adoption, and profits from infertility and abandonment. I find it appalling<br/>(FYI, I am holding back and trying to be polite as well as articulate when<br/>clearly I am very angry).<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Crystal Barlow<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a7f4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:55:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T16:20:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comments submitted by Crystal R.
