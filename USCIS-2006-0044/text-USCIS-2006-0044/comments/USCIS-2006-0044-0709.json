Please consider keeping <br/>fees the same as they currently are.  I do appreciate the fact that revenue is <br/>necessary to continue programs, however, currently families who are adopting <br/>from foreign countries often have to apply and thus pay twice for said forms.  I <br/>know that part of adopting is taking on the responsibility of the financial issues, <br/>however, it seems like double jeopardy to me.  We had to apply for our first I-171H <br/>in order to be accepted into the program.  We had no choice because the I-171H <br/>is required to admitted into the queue of waiting adoptive parents, even though we <br/>knew that time lines of adopting and I-171H validity did not match.  Now due to <br/>extended time frames for adoption and travel, we will probably have to go through <br/>the process again.  Please consider this request!  Thanks so much for your time.  <br/>I appreciate the opportunity to share my opinion with you!   Best wishes for a <br/>successful resolution to this issue that serves both the government agency and <br/>the individuals in the best way.<br/><br/>Respectfully yours,<br/><br/>Connie S.
