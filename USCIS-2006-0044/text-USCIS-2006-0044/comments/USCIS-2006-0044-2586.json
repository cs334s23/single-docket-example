We are adopting a beautiful girl from Guatemala.  You can?t imagine how<br/>beautiful our daughter is to us and how much we love her.  It is costing so much<br/>to get her home.  The fees to your office have run us $685, and if we have to<br/>get updated forms it will be even more.  If I work the numbers right, the cost<br/>with your new fee schedule will be $1660!  That is well over twice as much, and<br/>as much as I spend on groceries for about 5 months!  I know so many people<br/>taking out loans and saving everywhere they can to bring home their child. <br/>Please do not make it harder on good people to help a child and bring joy to<br/>their family.<br/><br/>I?m all for doing my part and I believe everyone deserves to be paid for their<br/>work, but this really seems excessive.  Please please try to find another way! <br/>Thank you.  --Adoptive Parent Alice Ross<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de8e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T21:38:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Alice Ross", "trackingNbr": "8021de8e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2586/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2586/attachments"}}}}}
