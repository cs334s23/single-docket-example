Today the exact same form costs a <br/>prospective adoptive parent $545.  Biometric fingerprinting, which began in 1998, has risen in <br/>cost from $25 to $70 per applicant.  For a two-parent family adopting a single child, the USCIS <br/>process costs an upward of $685.   Because of the instability concurrent with international <br/>adoption, many families find that their USCIS approval expires prior to their invitation to travel to <br/>their prospective childs birth country.  As a result, many families (especially those adopting from <br/>China and Guatemala) find themselves repeating the entire immigration application two or three <br/>times.  This can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars  money many of us <br/>simply do not have. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing applications and with its <br/>customer service.  Processing throughout the regional offices is erratic  some I-600A <br/>applications take months to process, while individuals in other districts received approval of the <br/>exact same form within ten days.  The refusal of officials to give adoptive parents priority results <br/>in children languishing in orphanages or foster care overseas for months and months at a time.  <br/>Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers (I-140) and employment <br/>authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 and 1.97 months, respectively) than that to bring <br/>home an orphaned child (3.39 months).   There is no explanation for<br/>why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected 859,543 I-765 and 129,743 I-140 applicants <br/>faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A applicants.  <br/><br/>  Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given greater scrutiny than adult foreign <br/>workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are met with deaf ears and <br/>directed to a status website which is not updated.  As a result of USCIS refusal to prioritize <br/>orphan petitions, thousands of children suffer needlessly.  There has been no move by USCIS to <br/>assist prospective adoptive parents whose documents expire while they wait for their childs <br/>home country to grant them approval to travel.  These parents are forced to reapply with USCIS, <br/>repaying the same exorbitant fees two and sometimes three additional times, each time <br/>subjecting themselves to the same long and uncertain wait for immigration approval.  If USCIS <br/>would simply extend the expiration deadline for the I-171H from <br/>eighteen months to three years, it would significantly reduce its workload without <br/>having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for what it needs, it is asking for <br/>what it wants.  It claims that this fee increase is designed to provide for an adequate and <br/>sustainable level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and processes designed to improve the <br/>USCIS ability to administer the nations immigration laws.  The Bureau justifies these increases <br/>by asserting that this fee rule would provide the necessary resources to maintain these <br/>processing time standards and fund further improvements to USCIS business operations to <br/>continue to reduce processing times while ensuring the appropriate level of security.<br/><br/>There are very few infants infiltrating Al-Qaeda.  The idea that adoptive parents are a threat to <br/>national security is laughable.  While we agree with the aims of the Department of Homeland <br/>Security, the additional levels of scrutiny on orphaned children and their prospective parents is <br/>absurd.  <br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud, improving service, <br/>changing benefit applications from paper to electronic means in order to streamline the process) <br/>forcing adoptive parents to bear the burden of these goals is unconscionable.  Worse still, many <br/>of USCIS stated aims do not directly benefit those seeking to immigrate.   <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and are mortgaging our <br/>homes and cleaning out our life savings to bring home a child.  Increasing the burden on us is <br/>not simply unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of waiting children.  We urge rejection of the <br/>current proposal and a new requirement that USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive <br/>families, give first priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork required for <br/>orphan petitions, and extend the expiration of the I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Melissa Dittrich<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021db73", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:18:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T12:31:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Melissa Dittrich", "trackingNbr": "8021db73", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2504/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2504/attachments"}}}}}
