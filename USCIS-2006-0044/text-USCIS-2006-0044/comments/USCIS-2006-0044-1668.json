The service many receive is beyond poor, <br/>inadquate, substandard, rude, and many more adjectives come to mind. To top it <br/>off, the laws are poorly written, confusing and not followed by other government <br/>agencies. Two of my children are adopted internationally, but because their <br/>country sends them to us on a guardianship and we then finalize their adoptions <br/>here 6 months later (South Korea and Hong Kong) we did not automatically <br/>receive their CoC for free, like children adopted from Russia, China, etc. We have <br/>to file, fill out endless forms, pay fees, pictures and even attend interviews like <br/>adult immigrants. Even though our laws state their are immediately a U.S. Citizen <br/>as soon as they are adopted by U.S. Citizens. <br/><br/>I am disgusted that the crappy service we receive from the USCIS thinks they <br/>deserve more money for such poor service. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219dc2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:37:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:36:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Victoria L.
