It places the<br/>burden of the costs for unrelated services on the backs of primarily young<br/>people in our country who are struggling to make ends meet and struggling to pay<br/>the already horrendous cost of adoption on top of it. These are primarily<br/>ordinary citizens with limited financial resources.  Many are forced to secure<br/>loans to bring a child into their family&gt; This take years to pay off and limits<br/>their spending for other goods and services until that is accomplished.  The<br/>process of asylum has nothing to do with adoption. This rule places undue burden<br/>on a group of people who cannot afford it, on a group who seek to raise children<br/>to serve our country and increase its well-being economically.  Increasing the<br/>financial obligations of this group to fund an unrelated government service is<br/>wrong. A rule to require those seeking asylum to borrow money to contribute<br/>would raise the outcry of &quot;they do not have the money to pay it!&quot; However, that<br/>at least would put the burden on the people receiving the service. Don&#39;t charge<br/>adoptive parents for services they do not receive. &quot;They do not have the money<br/>to pay it!&quot;<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a63a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:50:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T13:28:50Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Alisanne R.
