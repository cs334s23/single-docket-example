It seems <br/>unreasonable to make such huge increases in the price of these already <br/>expensive items. When people set out to adopt they are choosing to take on the <br/>responsibility of another human being. They are setting out to provide for someone <br/>who would probably not be adequately taken care of otherwise. This is already a <br/>pricey undertaking and it seems unfair to increase the prices of these things that <br/>are required for adoption.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef93", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:34:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Dana Scott", "trackingNbr": "8021ef93", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2828/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2828/attachments"}}}}}
