We are about halfway through the process <br/>of adopting a child, and already feel very overwhelmed by the volume of paperwork <br/>involved.  There are so many different documents that must be obtained and <br/>applications that must be completed, and the overall expense is very high.  It is <br/>difficult to prepare for the expense, especially when the travel time to a foreign country <br/>is variable.  Any additional expense built into the process makes a difficult and often <br/>prohibitively expensive endeavour even more difficult to afford, and ultimately those <br/>most hurt are the orphans who will not be adopted into a loving home.  That money <br/>would be better spent on care for the children.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a87a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:56:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:22:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by David Shardell", "trackingNbr": "8021a87a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1877/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1877/attachments"}}}}}
