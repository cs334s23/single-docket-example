Today the exact same form costs <br/>a prospective adoptive parent $545.  Biometric fingerprinting, which began in 1998, <br/>has risen in cost from $25 to $70 per applicant.  For a two-parent family adopting a <br/>single child, the USCIS process costs an upward of $685.   Because of the instability <br/>concurrent with international adoption, many families find that their USCIS approval <br/>expires prior to their invitation to travel to their prospective childs birth country.  As a <br/>result, many families (especially those adopting from China and Guatemala) find <br/>themselves repeating the entire immigration application two or three times.  This can <br/>increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars  money many of us simply <br/>do not have. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing applications and <br/>with its customer service.  Processing throughout the regional offices is erratic  some <br/>I-600A applications take months to process, while individuals in other districts received <br/>approval of the exact same form within ten days.  The refusal of officials to give <br/>adoptive parents priority results in children languishing in orphanages or foster care <br/>overseas for months and months at a time.  Most egregious is that the processing time <br/>for immigrant workers (I-140) and employment authorization (I-765) are less (average <br/>of 3.31 and 1.97 months, respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned child (3.39 <br/>months).   There is no explanation for<br/>why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected 859,543 I-765 and 129,743 I-140 <br/>applicants faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A applicants.  <br/><br/>  Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given greater scrutiny than adult <br/>foreign workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are met with deaf ears <br/>and directed to a status website which is not updated.  As a result of USCIS <br/>refusal to prioritize orphan petitions, thousands of children suffer needlessly.  There <br/>has been no move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive parents whose documents <br/>expire while they wait for their childs home country to grant them approval to <br/>travel.  These parents are forced to reapply with USCIS, repaying the same exorbitant <br/>fees two and sometimes three additional times, each time subjecting themselves to the <br/>same long and uncertain wait for immigration approval.  If USCIS would simply extend <br/>the expiration deadline for the I-171H from eighteen months to three years, it would <br/>significantly reduce its workload without having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for what it needs, it is <br/>asking for what it wants.  It claims that this fee increase is designed to provide for an <br/>adequate and sustainable level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and processes <br/>designed to improve the USCIS ability to administer the nations immigration laws.  <br/>The Bureau justifies these increases by asserting that this fee rule would provide the <br/>necessary resources to maintain these processing time standards and fund further <br/>improvements to USCIS business operations to continue to reduce processing times <br/>while ensuring the appropriate level of security.<br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud, improving <br/>service, changing benefit applications from paper to electronic means in order to <br/>streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to bear the burden of these goals is <br/>unconscionable.  Worse still, many of USCIS stated aims do not directly benefit <br/>those seeking to immigrate.   <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and are <br/>mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings to bring home a child.  <br/>Increasing the burden on us is not simply unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of waiting <br/>children.  We urge rejection of the current proposal and a new requirement that USCIS <br/>reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first priority to I-600/600A <br/>applications, consolidate the paperwork required for orphan petitions, and extend the <br/>expiration of the I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021db91", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:18:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T12:51:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Robin Sizemore", "trackingNbr": "8021db91", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2508/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2508/attachments"}}}}}
