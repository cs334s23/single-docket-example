The government should subsidize <br/>or keep at a token level fees for services like this.  Where is their tax money <br/>going?  If Congress people could allocate money for retirement and health care <br/>benefits for themselves and their spouses, why not for the naturalization fee of tax <br/>payers? If there is money for wasteful spending, subsidy for farmers, etc, for <br/>IRAQ, for legal services of prisoners why not for naturalization applications for <br/>taxpayers?<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207ef6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T19:45:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T23:34:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Ed G.
