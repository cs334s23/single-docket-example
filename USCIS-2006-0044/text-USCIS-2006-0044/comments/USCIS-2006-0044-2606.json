I would like to voice my <br/>opposition to the increase in fees for the 1600A. My husband and I are in the <br/>process of adopting a second child.  With the increased  wait times for adopting <br/>children from China, it is very likely that we would have to incur the fee for the <br/>1600A twice. Like other adoptive families, we are already scrounging and saving to <br/>bring home our child;  this 140% increase would have a large impact on our family <br/>and will be even more devastating if the full price has to be incurred more than <br/>once. <br/><br/>Adoptive parents are honest Americans who are just trying to do the right thing for <br/>their families and for a needy child in another country. I understand  the US <br/>Government&#39;s need to increase fees for this growing area of federal services, but <br/>the adoption process is difficult and expensive as is, and there is no need for the <br/>adoption community to be subject to this increase. By keeping the fees the same <br/>you will be doing a great service to this group of Americans.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021df8e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T01:39:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kristen Rice", "trackingNbr": "8021df8e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2606/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2606/attachments"}}}}}
