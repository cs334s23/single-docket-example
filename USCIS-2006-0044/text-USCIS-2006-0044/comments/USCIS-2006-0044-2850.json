My family is in the process of an <br/>international adoption and have been through the I600 and fingerprint process once <br/>already and will be needing to update shortly because our fingerprints <br/>just &quot;expired&quot; at the end of March and we have another 6-10 months to wait for our <br/>adoption to be finalized. <br/><br/>With the current wait times for international adoption, and talk of them only <br/>lengthening, it is very difficult for a family to pay these fees once, let alone two <br/>times during the adoption process.<br/><br/>The increased fingerprint fees are only justified if the additional cost is dedicated to <br/>developing a means for the prints to remain on file and not &quot;expire&quot;, then a family <br/>will only have to pay for that fee once.  There has also been a bill proposed to <br/>lengthen the timeframe beyond 18 months for an approved I600 since the wait <br/>times currently expire prior to an international adoption being complete.  Until that <br/>bill gets consideration I can not support the fee increase.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f06c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T21:12:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Suzanne", "trackingNbr": "8021f06c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2850/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2850/attachments"}}}}}
