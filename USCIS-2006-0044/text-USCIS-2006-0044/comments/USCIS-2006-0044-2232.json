I am writing on behalf of two young families who have <br/>generously decided to open their homes to children.<br/>The proposed increases are substantial. The cost of raising a family in current <br/>times makes it difficult enough to provide well for these children in need of a good <br/>home. If additional funds are necessary, surely there must be alternative <br/>mechanisms versus placing the burden on those who would adopt a needy child <br/>into their homes and families.<br/>I ask all involved in the decision-making process to please reconsider, <br/>understanding that these adoptive parents need support rather than face a <br/>significant increase in the cost to help these children, and rescind these proposed <br/>fee increases.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Phil Bryson<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c2e8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:51:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T19:02:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Phil Bryson", "trackingNbr": "8021c2e8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2232/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2232/attachments"}}}}}
