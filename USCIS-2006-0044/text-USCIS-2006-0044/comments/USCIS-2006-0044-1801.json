At a minimum, please skip <br/>this increase for adopting families.  My family is in the process of bringing home a <br/>second orphan.  We&#39;ve already had to pay the astronomical USCIS fees 3 times <br/>because the approvals only last for about 18 months.  Fingerprinting we&#39;ve paid for <br/>4 times because they last only about a year.  We&#39;ve been examined, studied, <br/>fingerprinted, reviewed and qualified by numerous agencies.  To have to submit to <br/>USCIS all of this information, plus pay huge fees multiple times is <br/>unconscionable.  And to raise the fees yet again is just too much.  I am a tax <br/>paying American citizen bringing into the country a bright child who will also be a <br/>taxpayer.  Let&#39;s make the fees reasonable for people following the rules.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jackie Chang<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a223", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:49:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T04:13:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jackie Chang", "trackingNbr": "8021a223", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1801/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1801/attachments"}}}}}
