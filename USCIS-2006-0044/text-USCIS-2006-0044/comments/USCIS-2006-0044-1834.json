It is bad enough, that one adopting from China at <br/>this time, must fill out the application twice due to the length of the adoption <br/>process.  An increase in the fee, is just adding an additional burden to families <br/>who are trying to help an orphan become a loving member of a family.  Please, do <br/>not make this any more challenging a prospect by increasing the fees, for an <br/>already expensive endeavor.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a706", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T18:43:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T14:54:08Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Karla M.
