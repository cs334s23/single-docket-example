I <br/>am in the process of adopting a child and hope to adopt more.  Adoption is <br/>expensive enough already and that is a natural deterrent to good would-be homes <br/>for unwanted children.  It is unconscionable for the government to raise fees by up <br/>to 66% for adoption-related petitions.  Further, immigrants seeking to do the right <br/>thing by following the proper processes under USCIS are only further punished by <br/>raised fees.<br/>As I stated, I am 100% opposed to this and believe it is an abhorrent gesture!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a674", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:50:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T13:50:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Amy B.
