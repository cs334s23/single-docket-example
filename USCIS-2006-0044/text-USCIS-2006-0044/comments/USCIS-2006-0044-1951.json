Please <br/>seriously consider the costs of giving these children a loving home....Please do <br/>NOT raise the <br/>USCIS fees for adoption. I would also like to see the 171H document life increased <br/>to be good <br/>for two years instead of just one since the adoption process is beginning to take <br/>longer. It is a <br/>very frustrating thing to have a case that takes longer and you have to get an <br/>extension on your <br/>171H or apply for another one altogether.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering these topics.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Chrystal Ballard<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b381", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:08:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T14:37:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Chrystal K.
