I <br/>believe if the proposed rule is adopted, filing fees would increase by an average of <br/>66% over current fees. <br/><br/>As a prospective adoptive parent, my greatest concern are the adoption-related <br/>petitions affected by the proposed increase:<br/><br/>I-600/600A (Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative)<br/><br/>$545 to $670<br/><br/>N-565 (Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship (used for <br/>name changes)<br/><br/>$220 to $380<br/><br/>N-600 (Application for Certificate of Citizenship)<br/><br/>$255 to $460<br/><br/>Biometric Services (fingerprints)<br/><br/>$70 to $80<br/><br/>Adoption is expensive enough already, and it is unconscionable to <br/>raise fees by up to 66% for adoption-related petitions. <br/><br/>Please consider the negative effects this proposal can have on prospective <br/>adoptive parents, and the children that are waiting to be adopted.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>PAP (Prospective Adoptive Parent)<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b627", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:17:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T19:18:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021b627", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2011/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2011/attachments"}}}}}
