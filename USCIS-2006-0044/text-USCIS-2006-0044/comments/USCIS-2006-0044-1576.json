At present I am stationed in Tanzania participating in <br/>the group processing of the Burundian 72 refugee group.  When I&#39;m not here I work <br/>in refugee resettlement in Grand Rapids, MI with a small outreach service grant.  <br/>Daily I meet with low income refugees and asylees who have legal status in the <br/>US who struggle to meet the fee requirements for applications as they are <br/>presently set.  These people are hard working and contribute through taxes.  The <br/>refugees were brought to the US with the understanding that they would have <br/>rights and opportunities for their families.  The financial strain of documents adds <br/>additional stress to their adjustment--which presents itself in the care of thier <br/>children, their performance in their work, and their overall life. <br/><br/>Being part of an organization currently inviting Burundian refugees to the US I <br/>would hate to consider having to inform these people that they will never have the <br/>opportunity to be a US citizen.  With the so many of these families struggling after <br/>resettlement, barely meeting poverty line incomes, such a significant portion of <br/>thier income should not have to be used to gain rights.  Law abiding, invited <br/>refugees should not be held responsible for the inefficiency of USCIS processing, <br/>nor should they be responsible to cover fees waived for others in equally difficult <br/>situations.  They pay their taxes, support their families, and are barely making it <br/>with the current documentation expenses.  We open our doors to assist these <br/>people, not to charge them for their opportunities.<br/><br/>I hope those of you making these decisions will take the time to connect with your <br/>local refugee service organizations to meet the people who will be effected so <br/>significantly by this decision before voting.  I can guarentee your decisions will be <br/>swayed in their favor.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219519", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-26T16:00:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-26T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-25T08:49:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Holly R.
