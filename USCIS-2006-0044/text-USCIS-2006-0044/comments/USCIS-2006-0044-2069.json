With the <br/>proposed increase in fees, it will be even harder to adopt.  Any slight increase in <br/>the fee will effect so many families in this same situation.  I pray that you will hear <br/>the voice of  many in the same situation and not put an increase on the <br/>immigration process.  Please it has been a long, hard and every expensive road <br/>don&#39;t increase the fees.  Many people are relying on you to help us.
