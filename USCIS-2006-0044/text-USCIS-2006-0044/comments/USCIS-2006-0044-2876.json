I am<br/>adopting a baby from China and have already paid you $615.00 in fees.  The<br/>waiting time in China has lengthened considerably and now I am facing having to<br/>redo my 1600A and fingerprinting (another $615.00).  There have been many bills<br/>introduced in the House to extend the length of the  I171-H and I can&#39;t<br/>understand if you are trying to reduce the backup why these times are not<br/>extended in the event of adoption.  You state that I must submit everything<br/>again, and I consider that a big waste of your time and mine.  I would think<br/>that as long as the paperwork is completed and submitted to a country for<br/>adoption that the timeline would hold until the paperwork in that country was<br/>done.  I find that the current amount to be EXCESSIVE if I have to do it TWICE<br/>for the SAME adoption.  I think it&#39;s absurd and a  waste of taxpayers money to<br/>REDO this paperwork more than once and then charge even higher fees.  I consider<br/>this raise to be excessive. I only get a 2-3% raise a year, so maybe a raise by<br/>10% would be acceptable. I don&#39;t think it necessary to increase the fees by 66%<br/>unless you extend the amount of time that my I171H is good for by 66%.  That<br/>should cover just about all who are adopting and facing a very long wait.<br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Kim A.
