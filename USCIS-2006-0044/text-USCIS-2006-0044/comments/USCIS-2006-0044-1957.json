Please reconsider how this will effect those who long to<br/>sacrifice so they can care for needy children in this world... DO NOT MAKE IT<br/>MORE DIFFICULT, IT IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH ALREADY WHEN DOCUMENTS EXPIRE AND MUST BE<br/>PAID FOR 2 AND 3 TIMES OVER!!!<br/>Please reconsider!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021abe7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:08:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T01:19:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Patricia M.
