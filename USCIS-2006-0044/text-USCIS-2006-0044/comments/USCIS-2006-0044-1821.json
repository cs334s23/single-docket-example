When a family decides to adopt <br/>internationally, they are already looking at much larger expenses.  Considering <br/>that only 1% of international orphans are adopted, why would you want to <br/>increase the fees and possibly discourage other families from adopting these <br/>orphans?  Although these increases may seem small in &quot;government terms&quot;, to a <br/>family saving every penny to be able to afford to adopt, this may be the fee that <br/>literally breaks the bank.  I am sure there are other, more creative, ways to <br/>achieve the same financial goals.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a676", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:50:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T13:53:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Mary Correa", "trackingNbr": "8021a676", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1821/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1821/attachments"}}}}}
