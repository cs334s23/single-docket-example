I am opposed to any increase in the fees for the filing of the <br/>I-600A and Biometric services.  The cost of international adoption is already <br/>prohibitive to most families, and any increase in cost will result in fewer children <br/>being placed in loving homes.  With the lengthening of many international adoption <br/>programs, many families will file the I-600A and have their fingerprints done <br/>multiple times.  Please do not create a hardship for these families, including my <br/>own, that are trying to help orphans from other countries.<br/>Thank you,<br/>Susan Banchero<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d727", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:17:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T21:52:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Susan Banchero", "trackingNbr": "8021d727", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2440/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2440/attachments"}}}}}
