We would <br/>love the opportunity to adopt again.  However, the cost of adoption is overwhelming <br/>to say the least.  We are not rich, we do not spend our money irresponsibly, we <br/>live simply.  As does the majority of Americans.  By increasing fees by such a <br/>large amount (66% !!) it makes adoption seem that much more impossible. And <br/>please try and remember, who suffers from this the most.  Put yourself in the <br/>place of a 3 year old child who wishes every day for a mommy and daddy and then <br/>tell them your going to make it even harder for their wish to come true.  Please, <br/>think of all the children you have a hand in helping by keeping adoption fees down.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219fff", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:20:20Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T22:47:22Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "na", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Christine I.
