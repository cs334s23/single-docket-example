Nobody likes to pay <br/>more - that&#39;s human nature. However, If you want to increase the filing fee, <br/>processing time should be reduced. Otherwise, I am againts the increase in the <br/>filing fee. We don&#39;t mind paying more if we get the result fast - then we can move <br/>on in our life accordingly. People are stuck up because they haven&#39;t heard <br/>anything from USCIS - its been year and year.
