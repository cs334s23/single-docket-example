For the American citizens that adopt children, the process of<br/>adoption is already a lengthy, trying process as well as expensive. Making it a<br/>more expensive and involved process accomplishes nothing except the addition of<br/>income to the respective government agency.<br/><br/>In addition, some adopting families who have filed applications recently will<br/>now have to start all over and pay the new higher fees to adopt and receive no<br/>refund of the amount paid for the previous application. This is nothing<br/>short of highway robbery.<br/><br/>Let it be known that I am hereby opposed to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration<br/>Services proposed rule docket number USCIS-2006-0044 and do not wish for it to<br/>be passed.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Samuel H.
