My husband and I recently adopted a newborn daughter <br/>from Zambia.  If the increased fee were to take effect, it would cause an additional financial <br/>burden to our family.  International adoption is already so expensive, that increasing the fee <br/>would only burden us more.  We are only trying to create a family.  <br/><br/>I propose that the people who work in immigration get a decrease in pay instead.  I have never <br/>been treated so poorly in my life as I did in the immigration office.  It is laughable that this slow, <br/>and demeaning experience should cost more than it already does.  Now, if the increase in fees <br/>would mean that the service would change from slow and demeaning to fast and service-with-a-<br/>smile, I might not be complaining.  But as it is, I was amazed that I paid so much money to be <br/>treated so poorly.  When I shell out that much money, I expect better service.  If the proposed <br/>fee increases come into effect, I expect better service.  Or at the very least, terminate Rebecca <br/>Davis&#39; employment.
