We already have a great financial burden. <br/>This will take away from the money we need for the care of ophans that we rescue in the world. <br/>Many of us have tried to adopt from the U.S., only to have the birth mothers change their minds - it <br/>happened to us twice. International adoption has enabled us to adopt our son - a great blessing in <br/>all of our lives. KEEP THE FEES LOW. Many of us have to file TWICE because the approval is <br/>only good for 18 months. We are in this situation, trying to adopt a brother for our son. With <br/>adoptions taking longer and longer, most of us have to file again as they do not permit us to renew <br/>our filing. You are going to place terrible burden on the families who are doing good in this world! <br/>Many borrow and go into debt to have a forever family :-(<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e726", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:40:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T02:58:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anne Files", "trackingNbr": "8021e726", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2719/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2719/attachments"}}}}}
