In the next couple of <br/>weeks, we will begin AGAIN to process our USCIS paperwork.  We will need to <br/>get re-fingerprinted and re-apply for I-171H form.  We have already spent $685 with <br/>the US government to go through this process once.  Now we must go through it <br/>again and spending a total of $1,370.  If your fees go up, we will spend $830 on <br/>our SECOND go around.  Spending a total of $1,515.  International adoption is not <br/>an inexpensive endeavor. It is emotional and monetarily taxing.  Your fee <br/>increases are huge (12.5% for fingerprinting and 18.6% for I-600A) Please <br/>reconsider your fee increases.  Most families have to go through this process <br/>twice with USCIS now due to the longer waits for most countries to adopt.  So you <br/>already are getting a double hit from the vast majority of adopting parents, we find <br/>it unconscionable that you would increase fees on top of that. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e512", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:38:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T20:38:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jim and Kim Walden", "trackingNbr": "8021e512", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2678/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2678/attachments"}}}}}
