International <br/>adoption is a costly process to begin with, and raising your fees will make it that <br/>much harder for many families to go that route.   I especially am troubled by this <br/>increase, since the I-171 form most likely expires before many families receive <br/>their Travel Approval to complete the adoption process.   This means that they will <br/>have to refile their I-600A and redo their fingerprinting process again.  The extra <br/>cost of going the process again is very frustrating.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207b11", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T18:41:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T19:21:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Melanie Novak", "trackingNbr": "80207b11", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0481/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0481/attachments"}}}}}
