However, it seems unjust<br/>that illegal immigrants are getting green cards earlier than us, because like 1<br/>million plus people out there, we are stuck in the black hole called FBI<br/>background check. Our case has been out of the time frame for 3 years, and yet<br/>USCIS and FBI refuse to do a thing about it. I believe the constitution grants<br/>everyone due process, citizen or not. And now the fee increase?! The inability<br/>of the USCIS to do their jobs translates to higher cost to us legal immigrants<br/>who has done nothing wrong except for following the immigration law? Does that<br/>make sense to anyone? <br/>Six hours of the cost of the Iraqi war, if diverted to USCIS, would save<br/>millions of us who are living in agony because of the backlog of USCIS, yet the<br/>congress refuse to increase the budget for the FBI background checking program.<br/>And now we are expected to pick up the slack? When we have been treated so<br/>unfairly by the USCIS?! It is an outrage and someone should be held responsibile, <br/>Please. I am appealing to your empathy and common sense. Think if you are in our<br/>shoes, how would you feel? <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020931d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:45:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-17T00:29:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "8020931d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0701/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0701/attachments"}}}}}
