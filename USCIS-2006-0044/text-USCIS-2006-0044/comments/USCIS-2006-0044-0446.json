We are currently in the process of <br/>adopting our child(ren) from China and we will soon have to re-file our I-600A due <br/>to its expiration while waiting to complete the process.  If the fees must increase, <br/>then the expiration date should be extended to match the realistic time tables of <br/>the international adoption programs.  The increase in fees and re-filing places a <br/>very heavy burden on the adoptive parents.  This may drive many potential parents <br/>away from the programs.  This would be a tragedy for those children waiting for <br/>loving homes.<br/><br/>Jarrett &amp; Melissa Addison<br/>Cairo, GA<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802074f2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:30:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T12:03:22Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jarrett & Melissa Addison", "trackingNbr": "802074f2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0446/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0446/attachments"}}}}}
