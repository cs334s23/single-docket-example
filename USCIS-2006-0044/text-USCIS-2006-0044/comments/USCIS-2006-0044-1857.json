With <br/>the I600a expiring in 18 months and the fingerprints expiring after only 15 months, <br/>that means many prospective adoptive parents will have to pay those fees twice. <br/>That means it?s not $125 increase for the I600a, but really a $250 increase.<br/>The fingerprints will cost people $160, not just $80, because the USCIS requires <br/>parents to be re-fingerprinted, instead of using the original set fingerprints for the <br/>second investigation. The result of these fees is the USCIS is in essence <br/>pressuring prospective adopters to choose the ?faster? programs over those that <br/>may be more established, stable and ethical.<br/><br/>I am strongly opposed to the increase in these fees, as I feel they are <br/>discriminatory and opportunistic.  Please re-examine this proposal and establish a <br/>more equitable fee structure.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a8d2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:54:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:52:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By William Buss", "trackingNbr": "8021a8d2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1857/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1857/attachments"}}}}}
