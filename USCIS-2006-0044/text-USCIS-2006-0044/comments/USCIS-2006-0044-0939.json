The proposed fee<br/>increases will place too heavy a burden on the backs of immigrants, many of whom<br/>cannot shoulder the excessive costs and will be forced to postpone their dreams<br/>of becoming U.S. citizens or remain separated from their families.<br/>The size of the proposed fee increases is particularly troubling since the Bush<br/>administration has indicated that it wants to help immigrants become U.S.<br/>citizens. For example, the current fee to apply for permanent residency is $325;<br/>CIS proposes to raise this fee to $905 (a 178 percent increase). The fee for<br/>naturalization (?citizenship?) applications would increase from $330 to $595 (an<br/>80 percent increase). These exorbitant fees would create undue economic hardship<br/>for many applicants and their family members. <br/>I respectfully urge the USCIS to work with Congressional leaders to identify an<br/>alternative and permanent funding stream that supports USCIS operations.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bbce", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T17:00:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T16:36:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Rita Ferreira", "trackingNbr": "8020bbce", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0939/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0939/attachments"}}}}}
