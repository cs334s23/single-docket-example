This<br/>is very upsetting to me. As a future adoptive parent in the middle of the<br/>process it is very frustrating and very costly, financially and emotinally. My<br/>husband and I have already spent almost $10,000 in fees, with at least that more<br/>remaining before we are able to bring our daughter home. Because of the short<br/>expiration time on fingerprints and the I171H form, it is inevitable that we<br/>will have to go through the stress and costs of re-applying for all this.<br/>(China&#39;s wait time now is up to almost 24 months). If USCIS does not extend the<br/>timeline for these forms and raises the costs, my husband and I are looking at<br/>an additional $830 out of pockets in addition to what we have already paid and<br/>we haven&#39;t even been able to use the fingerprints and I171H we paid nearly $800<br/>for before! This is outrageous and unfair. We only want to give a love home to a<br/>child who would otherwise not have one. Please reconsider raising these fees!!!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a4b5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T20:18:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T19:31:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Chinese Children Adoption International", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Katherine W.
