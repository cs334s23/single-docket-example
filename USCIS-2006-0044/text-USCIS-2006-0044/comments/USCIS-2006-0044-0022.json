For instance, the Internal Revenue <br/>Service just increased the fee to adjust a tax issue resulting from no error on the <br/>part of a taxpayer to $3,000 from less than $500.  Fees for applying for college <br/>loans are sometimes higher than what is being proposed by the agency and must <br/>be paid by students on an annual basis.  <br/><br/>In addition, if the consideration is for the immigrants who are poor, they are <br/>already benefiting from the EITC and child care credits.  <br/><br/>The amounts being proposed are not unreasonable considering that living in the <br/>United States and becoming a citizen is invaluable.  The fees even after the <br/>increase are a bargain.  Also, the department will not be as efficient and as <br/>professional as will be necessary to handle the workload in the future if it is not <br/>modernized.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9809", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T19:15:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T18:26:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Zach Wamp", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Edna F.
