Many immigrants are poor, work multiple jobs, and have large <br/>families.  By encreasing fees, we will create a bigger burden on those people who <br/>can&#39;t afford to apply.<br/><br/>My parents came to this country to offer us a better way of living.  I went to <br/>college and I am a law abiding citizen.  I am one of the lucky ones that was able <br/>to go to school and will be able to apply for citizenship. <br/><br/>Please take into consideration all the families that you will be affecting with this <br/>increase....Thank you for your time. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c27d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-10T16:09:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T18:23:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021c27d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2167/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2167/attachments"}}}}}
