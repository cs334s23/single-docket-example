This will increase adoption filing fees <br/>costs by an average 66% over the current fees.  My wife and I are in the midst of <br/>an international adoption that has been delayed and we will have to repeat much <br/>of the paperwork.  We&#39;ve already paid these fees once and will be having to pay <br/>them again.  I think adopting families should be given a break on the fees, <br/>certainly not an increase!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a02c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:21:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:12:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Robert E.
