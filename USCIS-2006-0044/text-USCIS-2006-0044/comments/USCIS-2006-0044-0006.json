I have no problems with the rate <br/>increases for the immigration procedure.  Fees for every service are going up and <br/>the agency must get the money to be able to handle their workload and update <br/>their capabilities and, most importantly, have the manpower to be able to review <br/>the applications for possible National Security violations.  I also know the <br/>hardships that can be caused by the length of the review process, and anything <br/>that speeds this up is a welcome relief.  However, I do not agree with the <br/>comment made by several people that this department should get funding from <br/>Congress.  I believe that if someone follows the rules and process for becoming a <br/>citizen they should be allowed, but I do not agree that my tax dollars should pay <br/>for that process.  I would be greatly saddened to see any sort of funding from <br/>Congress funneled to this issue!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f965d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T15:27:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T15:18:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michelle Kerr", "trackingNbr": "801f965d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0006/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0006/attachments"}}}}}
