Therefore we deem it our right to state <br/>how unfair it would be to increase fees for international adoption.  Couples who <br/>desire to adopt are already charged astronomically, and by increasing fees in <br/>such unfair amounts just adds more to the financial burdens.  Please refrain from <br/>this increase.  There are alternate ways to &quot;make budget&quot;, but not by increasing <br/>fees.<br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021abfc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:09:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T01:31:22Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ann and Jim Ryan", "trackingNbr": "8021abfc", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1962/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1962/attachments"}}}}}
