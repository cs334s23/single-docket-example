We have already met all of <br/>the requirements of our State to receive the I171 approval.  The problem is, our <br/>wait for our child will be longer than we had originally hoped.  Maybe 18 months to <br/>two years.  This means we will have to go through the approval process at least <br/>one more time.  Raising your fees will cost our familly money that we really need <br/>to bring this Child home and give her a loving home.  Please take in to <br/>consideration the longer wait times involved with international adoption.  Please <br/>decide not to raise your fees!  Thank you for allowing me to have a voice. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020c0a9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-28T16:00:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-27T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-27T13:51:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tracey A.
