The process is prohibitively expensive as is and this would place an<br/>addition stress on already taxed potential parents who are doing nothing more<br/>than trying to help a child in need.  If these fees are to rise there should be<br/>a graduated scale put in place.  The proposed increases are too steep, too soon.   <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b755", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:27:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T22:01:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa A.
