Most of the adopting families have to file <br/>TWICE because the original approval is only good for 18 months.

That&#39;s an increase of $975 <br/>or over 140%!  An exponentially high increase in cost without an increase in the <br/>services provided by the USCIS.  This increase will undoubtedly make it <br/>impossible for many families to afford the already high cost of adoption, leaving <br/>couples childless, and orphans without forever families.<br/><br/>Perhaps the government should re-align their priorities and allocate more funds to <br/>control the influx of *illegal* immigrants into the USA, and stop punishing those <br/>who pay the already high fees to bring immigrant orphans to this country legally <br/>and out of love.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dbcc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:19:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T13:27:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kristy Baird", "trackingNbr": "8021dbcc", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2518/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2518/attachments"}}}}}
