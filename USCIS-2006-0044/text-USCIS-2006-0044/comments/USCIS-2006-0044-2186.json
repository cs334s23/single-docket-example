We are already <br/>going to have to re-file the documents because of the increased waiting time <br/>associated with international adoption. This means we are currently paying double <br/>the intended amount. If any changes should be considered to the current process, <br/>especially those associated with adoption, it should be to increase the time the <br/>filed documents are valid because 12 months is NOT long enough and does not <br/>correspond with the current wait time on many international adoptions. Many <br/>families that are adopting internationally are already spending a considerable <br/>amount of money and the increase of the filing fees would only cause more of a <br/>hindrance in this already difficult process.
