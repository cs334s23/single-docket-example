Applying some common sense, there is no <br/>way you start from completely from scratch the second time when we refile...so <br/>you double your money for less than double the level of effort.<br/><br/>If you increased your fees by this significant amount, it would be easier to swallow <br/>if you used the extra funds to hire more staff - and give us better, quicker service.  <br/>But, we know that can&#39;t and won&#39;t happen as this move is to help the budget.<br/><br/>If you do enact these fee increases, I have two suggestions (that I honestly feel <br/>are constructive) I&#39;d like to offer:<br/>(1) Increase the expiration from 18 to at least 24 months (or even 30) to help us <br/>avoid paying the even higher fees TWICE (and to help reduce YOUR WORKLOAD).<br/>(2) Reduce the fees for second time filing for the same adoption (since you have a <br/>reduced level of effort associated with the renewal).<br/><br/>thanks for your time,<br/>rob gaulke, USAF<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de39", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T20:35:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Robert Gaulke", "trackingNbr": "8021de39", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2577/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2577/attachments"}}}}}
