The whole process is very expensive,even before <br/>going to China and with the wait getting longer and longer even more expensive. <br/>The big problem is with this wait being longer we have to renew many of our <br/>papers such as Home Study, fingerprints, and the 1600A. This is quite expensive <br/>the first time around but with a second go round and the potential increase of 60% <br/>or more is so very difficult for us working class people. Our goal is to bring a child <br/>in to our family and our wonderful free country to love and to be a furture asset to <br/>this country. Please reconsider these increases, as many adoptive families are <br/>also struggling to bring their children home to America.
