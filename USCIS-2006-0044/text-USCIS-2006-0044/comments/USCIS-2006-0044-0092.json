The immigration benefit <br/>application/ petition and biometric fee has been raised so many times in the past <br/>ten years. Ironically, these &quot;adjustment&quot; didn&#39;t make things better. From time to <br/>time, INS is notorious for its beauracracy and numerous mistakes which delay <br/>millions of new immigrants&#39;  in getting green cards they deserve. They&#39;ve worked <br/>their butt off for this country and kept paying tax for years. Still, they have not <br/>seen the end of the tunnel. It&#39;s so unfair and outrageous!!!!! Now, it&#39;s time for INS <br/>to put in place a more sensible, responsible, and fair immigration policy in place <br/>to work for the interests of this great nation. <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9aa6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:56:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T02:57:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801f9aa6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0092/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0092/attachments"}}}}}
