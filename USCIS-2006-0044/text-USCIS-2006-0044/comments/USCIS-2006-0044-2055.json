We are in the waiting stages of <br/>the long adoption process.  We feel that adoption is a heartfelt choice in giving a <br/>home to a child who needs a mother and father.  <br/><br/>The process itself is long and consuming.  Emotions are at its highs and its lows.<br/>The process itself in terms of monetary amounts is already high.  To increase the <br/>proposed fees would make it a hardship on many families.  This might have an <br/>impact on their decision on whether to adopt once or even again.  Please do not<br/>put this kind of strain on families who have the love to give to a child who so <br/>desperately needs a home.  My husband and I feel strongly against the proposed <br/>plans to increase the stated fees.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration on this very important matter.<br/><br/>Karen<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021acbb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:57:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T03:00:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Karen Siu", "trackingNbr": "8021acbb", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2055/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2055/attachments"}}}}}
