The range of increase <br/>between minimum of 100% to more than 300% is mind blowing. As far as I know <br/>most immigrant families currently pay a high price to an already costly system <br/>which not only includes the pricy lawyers but also the high fees.<br/><br/>Just to review the things in some prospectus lets assume the other general prices <br/>which the American Citizens pays, say the gas price becomes only twice to <br/>$5.50/gallon from current $2.75/gallon, the milk price becomes $9.00 from $4.50, <br/>the one bedroom apartment rent becomes $2550 from $1275, it surely appears to <br/>be a doomsday.<br/><br/>How possibly an agency can assume these increases to be fair or just. My focus <br/>is only to N400 which is the application of Citizenship. For me and my wife <br/>application cost alone will be approx $1400 including the biometric identification. I <br/>recently told my wife about this fee hike, her initial reaction was disbelief followed <br/>by laughter and than a plan to start saving at least $100 for next two years before <br/>we ever file application for citizenship. Please note that we already put a lot of <br/>money towards immigration matters before coming to this point of citizenship. We <br/>also have two small kids and there needs cannot be cut.<br/><br/>Honestly I have never heard of such a drastic increase in fee for any matter. Even <br/>in the country where I used to live and prices can go up and down as a usual <br/>practice but never even close to this fee hike proposal.<br/><br/>I really urge the congress to look deep into matter and do the justice that?s what <br/>the only thing the citizens of democracy desires.<br/>Thanks<br/><br/>SMO <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fac5d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-06T14:42:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-06T04:49:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801fac5d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0184/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0184/attachments"}}}}}
