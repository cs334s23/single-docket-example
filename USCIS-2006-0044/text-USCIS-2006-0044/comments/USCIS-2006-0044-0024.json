We are talking <br/>about 80% increase for naturalization, that&#39;s too much. Imagine, if you are my <br/>boss, will you give me 80% salary increase this year? If you can&#39;t do it, how can <br/>you expect others to to it. USCIS can&#39;t get money from the government and try to <br/>rip off the hardworking immigrants. You guys are worst than thief, robbers, rip us <br/>off &quot;legally&quot; and never get punished. I don&#39;t mind if there&#39;s a 10-20 percent <br/>increase, but not 80%. Beside, you guys provide horrible services. The place I <br/>hate to go the most is the immigration office. I am glad that I am already a US <br/>citizen.
