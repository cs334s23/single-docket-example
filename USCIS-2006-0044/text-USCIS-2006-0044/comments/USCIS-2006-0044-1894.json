As you know, there are millions of children throughout the world <br/>waiting for forever families. For many families and children, this increase will <br/>prohibit their adoption dream from being possible. Acceptance of this regulation <br/>would be a devastating setback to many families who have considered adopting. <br/><br/>My husband and I had difficulty conceiving our first child and underwent numerous <br/>fertility treatments to achieve a successful pregnancy.  We will be exploring <br/>adoption to increase our family in the near future and are currently unsure how we <br/>will raise the funds necessary to adopt.  This regulation could very possibly be the <br/>final blow to eliminate our dream of adopting.  Please reject this increase in fees.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a9c2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:58:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T19:37:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021a9c2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1894/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1894/attachments"}}}}}
