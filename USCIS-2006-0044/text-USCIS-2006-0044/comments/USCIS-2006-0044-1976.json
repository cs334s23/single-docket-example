I find this increase to be discriminatory in nature.  Other <br/>pieces of identification needed to function in the US have no or little fee attached <br/>to changing a name.  But the COC has an already hefty fee attached just for a <br/>name change.  Since this document is only needed by naturalized citizens, it <br/>would seem punative to have such a fee, much less make it higher.  It does seem <br/>that natural born citizens are treated in a more fair way.  As far as the increase on <br/>the 1600/1660A applications and the biometrics fee, this seems, too, <br/>unnecessary and as though the government has found a cash cow to take <br/>advantage of.  This is particularly true when one considers that most inter-country <br/>adoptions take far longer than the period for which the documents are valid.  Many <br/>applicants are having to redo the entire application...along with their attached <br/>fees...twice already.  To increase these fees works against those applicants who <br/>are trying to bring children into their families.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b4ac", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:10:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T16:42:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Elizabeth A.
