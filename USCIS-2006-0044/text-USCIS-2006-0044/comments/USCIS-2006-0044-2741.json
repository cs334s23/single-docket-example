The <br/>process to adopt internationally is already very expensive and increasing these <br/>fees by such large amounts will just add to the financial pressures we are already <br/>facing.  In addition, many international adoption process are taking more than the <br/>18-month time limit allowed by the approved I-600A so many adoptive parents are <br/>having to refile an I-600A for the same adoption.  <br/><br/>Please reconsider the exorbitant increases you are proposing.  If you must <br/>increase the fees, please consider the costs that we adoptive parents are facing <br/>during our adoption process and increase the fees by MINIMAL amounts.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021eb92", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T12:32:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Patricia Eaton", "trackingNbr": "8021eb92", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2741/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2741/attachments"}}}}}
