Processing time is extended and documents are valid for too short a <br/>period.  The current fees are sufficient for services provided.  Increasing the fees <br/>will increase the financial burden on potential adoptive families.  This proposed <br/>increase along with the expected increases anticipated from implementation of <br/>Hague requirements and the increase in processing time for all adoptions will <br/>result in families not being able to adopt because of financial reasons.  Unless the <br/>goal is for international adoption to be limited to the wealthy any and all fee <br/>increases should be implemented only if validity periods for the documents are <br/>extended.
