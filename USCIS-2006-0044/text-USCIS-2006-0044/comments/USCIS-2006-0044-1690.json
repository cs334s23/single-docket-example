However, due to the long referral wait time with China, I am sure I will <br/>need to re-file with CIS.  Adoption is expensive enough without having to re-do <br/>paperwork with costly fees, let alone having to re-file at higher rates.  Will my <br/>fingerprints change over the next 12 months?  I don&#39;t see how that is possible.    <br/>Why can&#39;t the existing prints just be run through the database again?  This whole <br/>process is exhausting and seems filled with inefficiencies. Not to mention that it is <br/>impossible to get any information from CIS - once the paperwork is filed it enters <br/>an abyss and then one day a little envelope comes in the mail.  Do you know how <br/>unsettling and upsetting it is to not have any control or information during this <br/>rather lengthy processing?  What other agency can get away with saying &quot;don&#39;t <br/>call us and we certainly won&#39;t call you.&quot;  I was lucky enough to have my <br/>congressman&#39;s office make periodic inquiries to keep us updated, but most people <br/>don&#39;t have that luxury.  Why do we make it so hard for people to do something <br/>good? I&#39;m sure more people would adopt if it wasn&#39;t for the cost and this daunting <br/>paperwork process. If you must raise the rates then please consider some sort of <br/>discount rate for people who&#39;ve had their paperwork expire due to long referral <br/>times, or please consider extending the period of time the visa and fingerprints are <br/>valid.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e4d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:12:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Christine McClean", "trackingNbr": "80219e4d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1690/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1690/attachments"}}}}}
