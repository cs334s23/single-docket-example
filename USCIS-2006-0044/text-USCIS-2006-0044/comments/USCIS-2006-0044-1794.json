The <br/>international adoption process is expensive and USCIS gives very little service for <br/>the fees charged. Our I-600 will most likely expire prior to travel, as  it will for the <br/>majority of families adopting from China over the next couple of years.  It would <br/>make more sense to incease the period of valitity of the I-600, which would reduce <br/>the number of duplicate appointments required under the current system.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kristen Koines<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a1c2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:48:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T02:57:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kristen E.
