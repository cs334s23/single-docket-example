In reading over the proposed changes I noticed several points that <br/>seem to me to be unfair to many of the applicants.  They are namely:<br/><br/>1.  US citizens should not be burdened with the cost of providing &quot;FREE&quot; services <br/>to non-US citizens, those deemed unable to pay, or other exempt applicants.  <br/>This concept rewards people who have little or no resources at the cost of those <br/>who do.  I do not agree with the federal government assuming responsibility for <br/>supporting people who cannot support themselves.<br/><br/>2.  The document states that several fees have been merged together  &quot;so <br/>applicants will pay a single fee rather than paying several fees&quot;.  This leaves me to <br/>assume that I may be forced to pay for services I do not want or need.  When I go <br/>to the grocery store I only pay for the things I want.  Why should the USCIS fees <br/>be any different?<br/><br/>3.  As an adoptive parent I am already beaten down with regulations, fees, forms, <br/>renewals (including renewal fees) and now increased fees.  My wife and I are like <br/>so many other adoptive families who desire to adopt a child from outside of the <br/>US.  We need to work with the USCIS to perform background checks on us and <br/>also to provide citizenship for our adopted child.  <br/><br/>I understand the need to recover costs, but please re-consider the allocation of the <br/>fees.  The proposed changes impose added burden on adoptive families who <br/>intend to support their child, and give favor to persons who cannot support <br/>themselves. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e69c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:40:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T01:28:43Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by David Gray", "trackingNbr": "8021e69c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2706/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2706/attachments"}}}}}
