First of all, raising the fees will discourage the immigration and will <br/>keep us staying in the states. As a net result, the intelligence of these immigrants <br/>will moved to the competents of USA. Secondly, substantial increase the charges <br/>one after another time is out of the  limit of the applicant since most of us are not <br/>rich at all. Finally, we paied tax every year which should be the major financial <br/>source of maintaining the BSCIS, why ask so much more from the applicants?<br/>Thank you for your consideration. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9f96", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T18:51:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T16:32:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801f9f96", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0118/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0118/attachments"}}}}}
