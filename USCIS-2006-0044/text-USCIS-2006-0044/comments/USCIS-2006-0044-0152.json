I have been involved with INS and currently now the USCIS <br/>department and the fees have always increased probably because of your thinking <br/>that immigrants will pay any fees imposed by them than risking the <br/>consequences with your department. <br/><br/>I am all for increase in fees if this translates to faster processing times and better <br/>services. I still don&#39;t see that happening and still face below par treatment when <br/>dealing with your department. How often do we see increases in fees for other <br/>services that we obtain for our daily life like utilities, phone bill etc. They don&#39;t <br/>increase fees by leaps every 2 years or so. Please be aware of the prices of other <br/>services in society before making this fee increase.<br/><br/>Your respectfully,<br/><br/>A Potential citizen.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa310", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T16:17:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-03T17:44:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By a Potential Citizen", "trackingNbr": "801fa310", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0152/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0152/attachments"}}}}}
