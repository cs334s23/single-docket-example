My husband and I are among those many <br/>prospective parents experiencing the long wait to adopt a girl from  the P.R <br/>China.  We already have our paperwork submitted (since last May) and are <br/>approaching the expiration of our fingerprints and I-171.  Unless Congress <br/>changes the expiration of I-171 from 18 month to 24 months,  we will be re-<br/>applying for these documents again,  and incurring considerable expense to do so <br/>to update all the forms needed to submit the I-600.   I urge you to not add to our <br/>expense of re-application of the I-600 form by increasing the fees charged for <br/>such.  Of course if the fee is increased we will pay it as we are committed to <br/>adopt a child from China,  but it would ease our financial outlay if the fees were <br/>not increase from their current level.<br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480215d47", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-19T16:25:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-19T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-19T04:31:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Melene A.
