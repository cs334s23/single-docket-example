Adoption of any sort is already very expensive <br/>without raising these fees. In addition most of the forms such as fingerprints, I17h <br/>are only good for 12 to 18 months before they expire, which with Chinese <br/>adoption, they will, then the adoptive family must come up with this money again.  <br/>Most adoptive families are not wealthy, we can not afford to pay these fees again <br/>expspecially if the fee prices are raised.  Please allow families to continue <br/>adopting children who need homes, DO NOT RAISE YOUR FEES!!!!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b891", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T23:44:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T02:24:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Mitch McConnell", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Cheryl Lindner-Taylor", "trackingNbr": "8021b891", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2079/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2079/attachments"}}}}}
