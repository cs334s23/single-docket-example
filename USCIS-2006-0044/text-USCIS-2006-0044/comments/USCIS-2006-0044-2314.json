It is a very long and difficult process, in every way.  Currently proposed fee <br/>increases for fingerprinting and I600As would only add to this burdensome <br/>process.  Did you know  that in many areas of the country families wait MONTHS <br/>for EACH of these items (fingerprinting, I600A) in their adoptive process?  Did you <br/>know that the international adoption process now takse so long that the <br/>fingerprints and I600A &quot;expire&quot; before the adoption is complete, forcing families to <br/>re-do the entire process again, including paying all of the fees again???  I ask <br/>these things respectfully, as I believe people outside of the adoption community <br/>are not aware of the huge problems with the whole international adoption process-- <br/>I know we weren&#39;t prior to entering into it ourselves...  Increasing fees so <br/>dramatically would be another huge burden on families who are already stretched <br/>thin in many cases, trying to bring an orphan into a loving home.
