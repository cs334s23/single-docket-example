I am a victim of DOL and USCIS inefficiencies, they<br/>operate on their own and are not answerable to any government audits. <br/>Instead of increasing the fee drastically, USCIS directors should first improve<br/>the efficiency of the organization, make it more nimble, right now it is nothing<br/>more than just an employment agency. If USCIS were a private company it would<br/>have gone bankrupt already.<br/>Nothing will change, I do not expect USCIS will be more efficient even if you<br/>give them 10 times the money they are proposing at this time, it is bred in the<br/>culture of managers and directors.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206b3e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:11:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T23:34:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80206b3e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0436/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0436/attachments"}}}}}
