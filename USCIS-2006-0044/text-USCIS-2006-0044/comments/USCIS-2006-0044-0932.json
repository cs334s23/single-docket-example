Because of the long wait between the acquisition of our form I-<br/>171H and actually receiving our daughter, we would be forced to complete a <br/>second form I-600A and again pay the associated costs.  An increase in the <br/>costs for these forms places an additional financial burden on our adoption <br/>process.  Please be aware that there are many families that have already been <br/>required to pay these fees twice.  This duplicate payment will continue for any <br/>family adopting a healthy child from China.
