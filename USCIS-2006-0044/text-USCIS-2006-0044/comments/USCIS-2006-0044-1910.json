We didn&#39;t, however, have to renew our documents <br/>because of time issues. If the change is made to the price of the documents, fingerprints,etc., it <br/>will become a financial hardship for those who have to renew documents prior to adoption. Because <br/>China is extending the wait time for adoption, renewal of documents and fingerprinting is inevitable. <br/>Please do not make it more prohibitive for families to adopt these abandoned children. Keep the <br/>cost the same for the documentation and fingerprinting.<br/>Thank you,<br/>Margaret F Stutzman <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aa6e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T02:49:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T20:41:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Margaret F.
