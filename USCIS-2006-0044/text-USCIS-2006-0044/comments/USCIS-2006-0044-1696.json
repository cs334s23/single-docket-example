Illegal immigrants and legal immigrants are <br/>having a hard enough time finding employment that pays enough to feed <br/>themselves and/or their families.  If these fees are increased (all but 1 fee <br/>increasing at least 40%), how are the immigrants supposed to afford to become <br/>legal?  In addition, some of the forms are used in conjunction with adoption <br/>overseas.  Adoption already costs a small fortune ($10k - $50k).  Raising the fees <br/>66% does nothing to assist these children that need a chance to thrive, grow, and <br/>eventually pay taxes.  Most parents interested in and pursuing adoption are not <br/>wealthy.  They have to beg, plead, finance, and fundraise for this money already.  <br/>Why are we making it even more difficult to become an American Citizen when we <br/>already have more illegals than the country can handle?  This does not solve the <br/>problem.  It only increases it.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e6f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:34:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:20:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Mary C.
