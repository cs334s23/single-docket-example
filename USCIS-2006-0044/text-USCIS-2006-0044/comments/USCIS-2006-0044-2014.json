There are many orphaned and abandoned children whom need a family <br/>to call their own.  I ask that you please consider what such drastic increases will <br/>mean to these children who only need to be given a chance, but will not receive an <br/>opportunity due to the financial strain placed on American families as they <br/>consider pursuing adopting as a means for growing their families.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b647", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:17:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T19:36:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Chrystal Lindell", "trackingNbr": "8021b647", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2014/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2014/attachments"}}}}}
