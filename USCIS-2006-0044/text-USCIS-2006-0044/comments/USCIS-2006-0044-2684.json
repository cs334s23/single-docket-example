The expiration date for the current fingerprints and USCIS <br/>required for this adoption are so short at the present time, that we will need to redo them before we <br/>can even go to get our child.  Raising the rates will put an additional burden on all of the families <br/>who are trying to adopt children from other countries.  This seems a bit excessive when our <br/>representatives will not increase the expiration date on this particular portion of the adoption <br/>process.  Please do not increase the fees knowing that all of the families involved in this process <br/>will need to do this a second time.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e532", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:38:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T20:56:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by M.E.G", "trackingNbr": "8021e532", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2684/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2684/attachments"}}}}}
