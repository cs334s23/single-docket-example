In 2006 <br/>have worked landside at a couple of airports where a criminal background check <br/>was required.  The airports were able to clear me to work quickly.  Therefore you <br/>would also expect the FBI name check for USCIS to be completed quickly.  <br/>however this is taking an eternity.<br/><br/>If the additional fee increase enables USCIS and the FBI to clear the background <br/>checks quickly then its a good reason to increase the fee.  However if the funds <br/>are used elswhere then the increased fees specifically for adjustment of status <br/>cases is an unjust and unfair way of supplementing other underf unded programs.<br/><br/>i believe any increases in fees should be used directly for the benefit/service for <br/>which the fee was paid.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480209311", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:45:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-17T00:27:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Congressman Issa", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "80209311", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0700/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0700/attachments"}}}}}
