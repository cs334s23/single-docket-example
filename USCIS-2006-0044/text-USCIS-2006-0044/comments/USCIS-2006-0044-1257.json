The cost of <br/>international adoption is already very high and for those of us adopting from China, <br/>we have to pay these fees twice due to the length of time. (It would also be nice if <br/>we could get a free renewal since it&#39;s not our fault the process takes so long).<br/><br/>It would be a shame for people to give up on the thought of international adoption <br/>because it is cost-prohibitive. <br/><br/>This policy affects real people with real babies waiting. It is also real money that <br/>comes out of our pockets.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering not raising the fees. It would mean a lot to thousands of <br/>families.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021349e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T15:35:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-13T13:42:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Marcia Blackburn", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Clint R.
