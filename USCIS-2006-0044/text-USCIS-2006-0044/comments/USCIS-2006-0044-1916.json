I am in <br/>the process of adopting a child from China using World Child International.  My <br/>application was submitted in February of 2006.  The waiting time for an adoption <br/>from China was 7 months when I started the process, but has lengthened <br/>considerably, likely reaching 24 months before our adoption is complete.  Having <br/>to reapply for the I-600A twice and even possibly three times represents a <br/>financial hardship for my family.  International adoption is extremely expensive.  <br/>Increasing the fees for waiting families represents an undue hardship.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aa91", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T02:50:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T21:03:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kelley Nicholson-Flynn", "trackingNbr": "8021aa91", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1916/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1916/attachments"}}}}}
