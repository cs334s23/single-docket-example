We have already <br/>had to pay all the fees, but because the I 171 H is only good for 18 months and <br/>the fingerprints for 15 months, we have to redo everything again before our <br/>adoption is complete.  Having to pay twice is already very difficult, with all of the <br/>expenses we are facing with this adoption, but increasing the rates on top of <br/>everything else is totally unfair.  If you are going to increase the rates, then at <br/>least make the adoption paperwork and fingerprints last long enough for us to <br/>complete our adoption, without having to renew them.  Thank you for considering <br/>our situation, and that of thousands of other adoptive American families.<br/><br/>Sincerely,  Heather and Thomas Wangeman<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021df76", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T01:08:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Jane Harman", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Heather Wangeman", "trackingNbr": "8021df76", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2605/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2605/attachments"}}}}}
