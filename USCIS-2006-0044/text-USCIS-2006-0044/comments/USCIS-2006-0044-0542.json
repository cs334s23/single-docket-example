IInternational adoption is an expensive endeavor to begin <br/>with and your department is not helping any.  Moreover, I have always viewed your <br/>desire to charge the American taxpayer for services that we are already paying for <br/>through our taxes as redundant.  Since I already pay my taxes, your <br/>fees are similar to &quot;double dipping&quot; into my pocket book. <br/><br/>Please, dispense with the fees hikes.  Rather, I would like to see your deparment <br/>extend the deadline for re-fingerprinting since many of us who are adopting from <br/>China now face long delays.  What was once an 8 month wait has now turned into <br/>a 16-18 month wait because China has slowed down the adoption process.  An <br/>extension would send a clear signal to the American public that the USCIS is <br/>working on the behalf of the American citizen.   <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207fcd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T20:00:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T02:01:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Burgess", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Andrew L.
