Adoption costs enough as it is and many children grow up in an <br/>orphanage and are then put out on the streets because people can&#39;t afford to <br/>adopt.  The US immigration is already expensive enough.  Please consider making <br/>the immigration work more efficiently rather than just raising prices.  As most <br/>adoptive parents know, you can call most USCIS offices and they ask you how to <br/>process the forms or what the form is you are talking about.
