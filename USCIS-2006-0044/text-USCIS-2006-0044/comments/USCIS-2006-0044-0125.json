When the legal <br/>path is so difficult and costly, it surely encourages people to come in illegally and <br/>stay below the radar.<br/><br/>I am AGAINST any type of amnesty, as this just rewards those who break the <br/>law. And those who break the law should &quot;on principle&quot; not be welcomed.<br/><br/>We need to fix the &quot;legal&quot; immigration system and this fee increase will only <br/>breaks the system more.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa183", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T19:03:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T18:51:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sean Gates", "trackingNbr": "801fa183", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0125/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0125/attachments"}}}}}
