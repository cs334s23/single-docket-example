The cost of <br/>international adoption is already unnecessarily prohibitive.  Why not instead &quot;self-<br/>evaluate&quot; and lower costs by geting rid of &quot;dead-wood&quot; (unproductive employees <br/>and processes)?  Make your processes more efficient and less bureacratic.  <br/>Please seriously consider other ways to achieve your goals without passing the <br/>burden onto adoptive parents and the children we want to love.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Katharine Hase<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ddbe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:07:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T19:15:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Katharine Hase", "trackingNbr": "8021ddbe", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2563/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2563/attachments"}}}}}
