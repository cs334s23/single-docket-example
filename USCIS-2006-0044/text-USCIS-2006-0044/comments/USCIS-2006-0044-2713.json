Our paper work arrived in China in July 2006.  Up to that point, <br/>we had spent a good portion of money allocated to the adoption through the <br/>finalization of the I-600/600A and fingerprints.  Aware of the costs of adoption, we <br/>had the money set aside for this one time processing fee.  <br/> <br/>We had expected to travel to China this winter/spring.  With the delays in the <br/>process, we are hoping to meet and legally adopt our baby by the end of this <br/>year.  Since both our fingerprints and I-600/600A forms will expire, we are <br/>expected to file a second series of I-600/600A and fingerprints.  Long have we <br/>thought that the expiration dates should be at least 24 months attached with <br/>a &quot;renewal fee&quot;.  With the proposed changes, not only will we have to pay for the <br/>second series but at a substantially higher price.  To repay for a petition that we <br/>were already been approved does not make sense.  To repay for fingerprints done <br/>last year does not make sense. <br/> <br/>People adopt children for varying reasons.  For us, it is to bring a child into our <br/>home so that we can love and enrich his/her life.   While doing so, the child will <br/>bring so much joy to our lives.  Due to the costs of adoptions, not everyone that <br/>desires to adopt are able to adopt.  Knowing and understand these costs, we <br/>were able to budget our money for the adoption.  We were aware and agree with <br/>the costs to a certain level.  Unfortunately, we do not agree with these proposed <br/>changes.<br/> <br/>We thank you for your time. <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e6ee", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:40:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T02:17:05Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021e6ee", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2713/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2713/attachments"}}}}}
