While there is an impression that people who <br/>adopt overseas are wealthy and for them money is no object, that is far from the truth.  The burden <br/>is already quite large and increasing it may only impact the ability of many people to adopt children.  <br/><br/>While I understand the need to cover the costs of immigration, I cannot imagine what it will be like <br/>for the thousands of adoptvie parents who have just begun the process, been saving money and <br/>budgeting according to the current schedule only to find that there is a 60%+ increase to the <br/>immigration fees, including the fingerprinting, etc.  This may completely halt some adoptions.<br/><br/>Please re-consider such a huge increase.  While I understand that raising the costs may be <br/>necessary, this isn&#39;t just about &quot;Illegal Immigrants&quot; and people &quot;stealing Jobs from Hardworking <br/>Americans&quot; as others have written.  It is also about the lives of some children in desperate need <br/>and the families who are already calling them their own.  Please consider a graduated increase <br/>designed only to cover the increase of actual costs.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Lorraine Rose<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b823", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T23:43:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T01:17:08Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lorraine Rose", "trackingNbr": "8021b823", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2064/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2064/attachments"}}}}}
