As an adoptive parent to be of a child from China, I have <br/>already paid the fees once and will now be required to do so again because the <br/>procedures for adoption in China exceed the 18 month expiration date on the <br/>approvals.<br/><br/>Proposals to increase the valid dates of the USCIS approvals have been already <br/>been declined so there is no way for an adoptive family to avoid paying the costs <br/>twice (with no additional benefits or services).   <br/><br/>By increasing the fees, a heavier financial burden is being placed on adoptive <br/>families who have already followed US laws and procedures once; we are being <br/>financially penalized for adoption processes that are beyond our control.<br/><br/>The US has already recognized the importance of both international and domestic <br/>adoption by providing a tax credit of almost $11,000.   While I know the money <br/>goes different places and impacts federal financing in different ways, this is an <br/>example of government agencies working in ways that are in opposition to each <br/>other and creating more unnecessary bureaucracy.<br/><br/>I understand that costs are rising and respectfully request that if fees must be <br/>raised, persons required to refile for adoption due to the adoption process taking <br/>longer than 18 months (and therefore by no fault of their loan) be required to pay a <br/>reduced fee for the second application.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dc1c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:20:21Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T14:25:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Catherine Buyarski", "trackingNbr": "8021dc1c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2525/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2525/attachments"}}}}}
