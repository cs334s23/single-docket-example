Because of <br/>extended wait times, rule changes and other issues relating to international <br/>adoption, many families find that USCIS approval expires prior to child referral and <br/>invitation to travel to their prospective child&#39;s birth country. As a result, many <br/>families find themselves repeating the entire immigration application two or three <br/>times. This can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars. <br/><br/>The process of adopting a child is long, difficult, frustrating and expensive.  Most <br/>prospective adoptive families are not wealthy:  most are merely middle class <br/>citizens, with a few resources - but not unlimited resources.<br/><br/>The proposed rate change, coupled with the need to reapply for approval (due to <br/>the short life of the I-171H), make it more difficult for middle class families such as <br/>ourselves to pursue international adoption. Is this your goal?  There seems to be <br/>no need for the federal government to make international adoption even more <br/>expensive and burdensome.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Elizabeth B.
