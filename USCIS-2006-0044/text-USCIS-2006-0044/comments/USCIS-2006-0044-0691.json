Even though it is understandable<br/>that  FBI name/security check is an important step that needs careful review, <br/>it is taking ridiculously long for most, if not all, applicants.  USCIS has to<br/>guarantee that FBI name check process will get resolved within a certain<br/>time-frame to justify the fee increase.  USCIS has to stop passing the blame on<br/>FBI for name check delays. As the Green card (I-485) applications are being<br/>receieved by USCIS, USCIS is the agency which is responsible for timely<br/>adjudication of the applications received by it. So, this fee increase should be<br/>done only after USCIS guarantees that Name check process will &quot;Not only be<br/>speeded up &quot; but also should be some &quot;Quantitative&quot; statement like &quot; FBI<br/>name/secuirty check will be completed with X months&quot;<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802091cd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:44:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T22:46:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "802091cd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0691/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0691/attachments"}}}}}
