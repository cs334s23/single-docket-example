An International adoption is an expensive endeavor, but one <br/>that is more than worthwhile for both a child and the adoptive family. However, due <br/>to the extensive time it may take to get a child into the United States it&#39;s possible <br/>that the approval for the adoption petition, the 171H, may expire and an adoptive <br/>family may have to resubmit for a 2nd 171H. The fee for the 171H is already fairly <br/>high and doubling it would really make it a substantial cost of the adoption. <br/>Please reconsider the fee increase.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208993", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:42:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T15:21:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Jerrold Nadler", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Margaret Cossman", "trackingNbr": "80208993", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0665/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0665/attachments"}}}}}
