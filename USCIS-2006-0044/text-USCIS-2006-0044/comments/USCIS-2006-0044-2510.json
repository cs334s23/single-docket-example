Adoption is an act of love and<br/>international adoption can be a bridge to international understanding.  Adoption<br/>is also already very expensive.  Adoption should not be a privilege for only the<br/>upper class.  My husband and I are considering adoption, but the costs are<br/>staggering. Please make a reasonable fee increase not 66%.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Monica Tetzlaff<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021db99", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:19:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T12:55:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "O'Donnelly", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Monica Tetzlaff", "trackingNbr": "8021db99", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2510/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2510/attachments"}}}}}
