While it makes sense that those applying for immigration <br/>benefits in this country should have to foot the bill for those services, it still does <br/>not seem reasonable to me that the government should raise these fees by over <br/>60% when most immigrants trying to make their way in this country can hardly <br/>afford the fees as they stand today.<br/><br/>Immigration is something that is close to me as it affects someone that I know. <br/>And when this person is able to apply for permanent residency in this country, I <br/>imagine that we would be willing (or forced) to pay whatever is necessary to <br/>achieve the residency he has been seeking for over 5 years. Why is it the US is <br/>so strict on keeping families apart? Good, solid, hard-working families that don&#39;t <br/>commit crimes, don&#39;t take advantage of the system, they are people that just want <br/>to provide a life for their family - yet the United States gov&#39;t cannot seem to agree <br/>on reinstating Section 245i so that multi-race families can live like American <br/>families, not in the shadows, not scared to do something in fear, but free and not <br/>held back from a better job. The United States has to recognize these people. <br/>They have to recognize the blended families where one part is an American citizen <br/>and the other is a citizen of another country. Why must we as a whole suffer along <br/>with those that are breaking the law? We are only trying to survive, only trying to <br/>lead a comfortable life, yet the gov&#39;t takes their sweet time deciding on something <br/>which only forces those families to struggle until a decision is made that will allow <br/>those families the same equality in this country that other American families have. <br/><br/>Why is it that everytime immigration is discussed in the news no one ever hits on <br/>the topic of illegal immigrants that are married to US Citizens? Why is that? Are <br/>these people not important? Do they not deserve something more then the illegal <br/>aliens that are coming here to take advantage of our state systems and the like? I <br/>believe that they do deserve more. I only wish that the people sitting in the seats <br/>at a gov&#39;t level would only feel the same. Why not help these people first? And <br/>then tackle the problem of the aliens that are here illegally and taking advantage of <br/>the systems the US has in place? Why must the good suffer for something the <br/>bad are doing?<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480210f5c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T18:52:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-09T15:36:08Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Angela Cordova", "trackingNbr": "80210f5c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1102/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1102/attachments"}}}}}
