For instance, a person who earns $7.00/hr, earns approximately <br/>$14,000/yr.  They may fall slightly above or below the poverty level, depending on <br/>their family size.  They barely survive paying their rent, utilities, food and clothing.  <br/>We find that people now are discouraged from filing for citizenship or adjustment <br/>of status due to immigration fees.  Often there are other, collateral fees such as <br/>required medical forms, photos, travel for fingerprints etc, so that the total costs <br/>are prohibitive.  To increase fees by a small percentage is reasonable.  To <br/>increase, in some cases by 100% or more, is not reasonable and not affordable.  <br/>Especially considering that people frequently have to file petitions more than once <br/>before they receive the benefit due them. <br/>It is the perception of the clients, that BCIS is attempting to pass the costs of <br/>possible legalization of undocumented individuals from Immigration Reform on ALL <br/>immigrants.  <br/>If fees increase by such a significant amount, it is expected that fee waivers will <br/>become much more prevalent.  Has Homeland Security considered the impact of <br/>substantial increase in numbers of fee waivers?  Also, will the poverty level for fee <br/>waivers increase to take in the low-income employed person who currently does <br/>not qualify under the existing fee waiver?<br/>In summary, this is not a reasonable proposal.
