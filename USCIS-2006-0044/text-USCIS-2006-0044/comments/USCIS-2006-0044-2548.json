The <br/>financial burden that adoption places on a family is significant.  It is ironic to that it <br/>can cost more money to provide a family for a child than to give birth to one.  In a <br/>nation that values the family unit, I would think it would be more appropriate to <br/>reduce the costs making these opportunities available to more families and more <br/>children.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dd27", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T17:58:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T17:25:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Christine Archer-Davison", "trackingNbr": "8021dd27", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2548/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2548/attachments"}}}}}
