As it is, we will most likely have to renew our papers, as the referral will <br/>most likely come after the expiration date.

In the least, any families <br/>already starting the process should not have to pay the increased fees, as they <br/>should be &quot;grandfathered in&quot;.  <br/><br/>Please reconsider the increase in the fees, thus making it more affordable for <br/>adoption of unwanted foriegn children.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021eca6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T14:25:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T14:48:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Lifelink Adoption", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ed Feldshau", "trackingNbr": "8021eca6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2759/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2759/attachments"}}}}}
