With the <br/>extremely high cost of adoption a rate increase of up 66% would crip the <br/>opportunities for families such as mine. There is no way that hard working <br/>Americans can afford to pay this huge increase. I ask that the USCIS NOT <br/>increase these rates due to the negative impact it will have on an already <br/>expensive venture. This is an outragous increase and will negatively impact the <br/>number of people attempting to rescue children from horrible situations in <br/>developing countries. Again, please do NOT increase the fees. Thank you for <br/>taking public comments before making a decision that will impact so many <br/>Americans and children around the world. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cfff", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:51:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T19:46:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Chadwick Gray", "trackingNbr": "8021cfff", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2416/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2416/attachments"}}}}}
