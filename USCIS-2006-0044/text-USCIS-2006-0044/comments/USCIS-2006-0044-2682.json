My <br/>husband and I have completed 2 international adoptions since 2000 and are <br/>currently waiting to complete our third.  We have seen the fees increase twice and <br/>this current fee increase will make it exceptionally difficult on us for two reasons.  <br/>First, the financial burden for adopting parents is already substantial, increasing <br/>these fees just makes it even harder.  Second, due to lengthening process times <br/>with the China International Adoption program, we will be forced to re-do our <br/>adoption paperwork through BCIS, thus incurring more costs.  I do not understand <br/>why these fees are necessary.  Certainly, they don&#39;t need to increase by as much <br/>as proposed.  Please consider that most people adopting are not in the upper tax <br/>bracket, many moms stay home to raise their children an the costs of adoption <br/>already in place are hard enough on most families including ours. Had we been <br/>able to have natural births, the cost to us would have been a mere $100 per child.  <br/>The cost per child that we have adopted has been $25,000.  I encourage you to <br/>seriously consider the points of view from the adoption community and not pass <br/>these fee increases.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sarah E.
