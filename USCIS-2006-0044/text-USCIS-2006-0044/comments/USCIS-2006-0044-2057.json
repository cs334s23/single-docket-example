My husband I are in the process<br/>of adopting our second daughter from China.  Adoption is expensive enough<br/>already and this would add yet another roadblock to keep parents from bringing<br/>home children who otherwise might live their lives in a foreign orphanage (well<br/>at least until they are teenagers and can, in some countries, be turned out onto<br/>the street).  Because China is so slow in giving referrals at this time we<br/>already know we will have to renew all our USCIS forms and our fingerprints. <br/>What in the world do fingerprints have to be renewed anyway?  They don?t change<br/>so why should they expire?! It is unconscionable for the government to raise<br/>fees by up to 66% for adoption-related petitions.  Immigrants who are here<br/>legally and are seeking to obtain citizenship and to follow proper procedures<br/>under USCIS are only punished by raised fees.  This entire country save for the<br/>Native Americans came here as immigrants!  I agree that we do need to make<br/>changes so that illegal immigrants are returned to their countries, however, the<br/>ones who are here legally should not have to be punished because the US does not<br/>have in place measure to keep out or deport illegal immigrants when they are<br/>discovered!  Maybe someone should think of a way to require a deportment fee<br/>from illegal immigrants.  That way the government might be more interested in<br/>finding ways to get the illegal immigrants out instead of charging more to those<br/>of us who are adopting or to those who are here legally.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b7e1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:57:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T00:20:58Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Carmi Henderson", "trackingNbr": "8021b7e1", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2057/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2057/attachments"}}}}}
