The world<br/>does not look toward the US as being heaven on earth, and such notions should be<br/>cleared from the minds of those that seem to be infested with them.<br/><br/>It saddens me to see the ignorant view of a few US Citizens which have<br/>previously posted comments on to the proposed price hike proclaiming that &quot;US<br/>residency and citizenship is invaluable&quot;, or that the &quot;price should be raised to<br/>make the illegal immigrants bear the costs they incurr&quot;(The several comments<br/>into that notion I&#39;ve read puzzle me as the USCIS will generally not be dealing<br/>with forms from illegal immigrants). Please wake up and smell the coffee, we may<br/>be in a good part of the world, but we are not best and not superior. Arrogance<br/>is not an honorable trait.<br/><br/>To end this comment then I object to the high level of price increases.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021841e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-26T15:41:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-26T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-22T17:13:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Patrick Mahoney", "trackingNbr": "8021841e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1566/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1566/attachments"}}}}}
