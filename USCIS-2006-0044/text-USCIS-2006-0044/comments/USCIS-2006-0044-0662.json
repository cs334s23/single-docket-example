I am adopting Internationally <br/>from China and I already have my I-600 approval (I-171H) but due to the increasing <br/>referral times I expect that approval to expire.  I have petitioned your agency to <br/>extend the approval time on the approval multiple times and now I find that you are <br/>desire to raise the rates for re-application!  It is already an unexpectedly large <br/>financial hardship to re-complete my entire Home Study and other necessary <br/>documentation to just re-apply for the approval. Now you are proposing to increase <br/>the fee again, which will continue to add to the financial hardship.<br/>I have heard your agencies statements for not extending the approval timelines as <br/>in the best welfare interest of the adoptive children and I can see SOME validity to <br/>that statement, but to then go and increase the fee just as a large number of <br/>families will be required to re-apply is WRONG!  I strongly urge you to reconsider <br/>this proposal.  I also STRONGLY implore you to establish a REDUCED fee <br/>structure for those of us having to re-apply due the arbitary expiration date of our <br/>first approval.  Better yet..... PLEASE JUST EXTEND OUR APPROVALS!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208952", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T20:27:01Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T14:51:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Pamela A.
