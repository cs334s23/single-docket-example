Upon further <br/>reflection, I was however driven to question the legitimacy and true motive for the <br/>enormous pending fee hikes. The reasons cited for the increase raise are evidently <br/>inadequate at the moment and necessitate careful review and justification. <br/>Arguably, the post 9-11 era has definitely changed the landscape for America, <br/>particularly in the areas of immigration and homeland security. Notwithstanding, <br/>financing the cost of these two crucial branches of the federal government should <br/>not be left to the mercies of lawful and would be residents of the US. Least it <br/>should be forgotten that the very fabric of the US was built by immigrants who <br/>today have coined the term &quot;resident aliens&quot; to their likes. Meanwhile, the agency <br/>boasts that almost 99% of its funding is derived from fees levied on those <br/>benefiting from the services. If the objective is to make the agency self-reliant, <br/>then all US residents ought to foot the bill. Immigration and homeland security are <br/>the heart of America&#39;s welfare and should therefore have the full budgetary support <br/>from the government. This is in no way intended to say that those who benefit <br/>directly from the services should not pay accordingly but that such flagrant <br/>imposition on those who are lawfully seeking the &quot;American Dream&quot; should not be <br/>the approach as this may very likely lead to more divisive means to the end?..<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802019ec", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-12T19:47:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-12T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-11T20:45:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Martha Charles-Glenn", "trackingNbr": "802019ec", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0305/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0305/attachments"}}}}}
