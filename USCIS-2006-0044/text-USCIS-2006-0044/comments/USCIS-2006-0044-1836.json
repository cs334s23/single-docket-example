Increasing USCIS fees <br/>not only discourages families from adopting, but also actively discriminates <br/>against families of lower incomes. In addition, the current fee, high at it is, in no <br/>way gurantees timely processing of paperwork. Paperwork that is &quot;suppossed&quot; to <br/>take 8 weeks is routinely taking 7-8 months. Furthermore, the process is by no <br/>means standard across processing centers or states. On one side of my state <br/>you can get paperwork completed in DAYS, while at another office it took 8 <br/>months.  <br/><br/>All children deserve a home, and we should make the process as efficient and <br/>clear as possible. <br/><br/>Thanks<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a712", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T18:44:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T14:58:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021a712", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1836/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1836/attachments"}}}}}
