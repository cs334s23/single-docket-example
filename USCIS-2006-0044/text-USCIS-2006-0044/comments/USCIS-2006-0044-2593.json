To raise these already high fees 66% is utterly <br/>ridiculous!  I have adopted 5 times internationally and we usually adopt sibling groups and with fees <br/>increasing that much it would be hard to cover that high of an expense.  Most of us who adopt are <br/>not rich and work very hard to raise or save up the money for our adoptions to help give children a <br/>loving home. A small increase I can understand but the increases you are proposing are utterly so <br/>expensive.  Is this increase happening so that you might deter people from adopting <br/>internationally?  Unfortunately, if this is so, there will be many kids who will never have a  loving <br/>home with any body, because adopting stateside is not as easy as they make it sound. Taking <br/>years to get a child into the adoptive home. I think raising these fees should be reconsidered. What <br/>is constituting such a high raise anyway?  Is somebody&#39;s government pocket not getting enough <br/>money in it?  This proposal really disgust me.  what&#39;s the deal here?<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021df03", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T23:23:05Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Bud Cramer", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Debra Carter", "trackingNbr": "8021df03", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2593/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2593/attachments"}}}}}
