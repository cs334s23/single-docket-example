I spent well over <br/>$50,000 to bring home my two children from Russia. Of course the children are <br/>WELL WORTH the money, however, adding another fee onto what is required of <br/>the UNITED STATES is just wrong. Many adoptive families have already spent <br/>tens of thousands of dollars in fertility treatments, foster care, and/or domestic <br/>adoption. Often an international adoption may be the only choice and to increase <br/>the fee required to bring that/those child/ren home is just another straw in <br/>breaking the proverbial camel&#39;s back. <br/>Having said that, if you do increase the fee, could you also increase our priority <br/>status? I wanted over THREE MONTHS to have the I-600A processed. I could not <br/>submit my foreign paperwork until this document was completed. I even had to get <br/>my senator involved! To increase the fee without also increasing the service is just <br/>a misuse of funds, in my opinion.<br/>Thank you for your consideration in this matter. I would welcome any opportunity <br/>to answer any questions you may have on this issue or any other adoption-related <br/>discussions.<br/>Sincerely, Kellie R.
