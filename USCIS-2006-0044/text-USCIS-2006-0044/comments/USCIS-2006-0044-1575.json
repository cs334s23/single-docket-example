We began this process in <br/>November of 2005.  As the process slows down more and more each day, we are <br/>waiting for our daughter.  Now we learn that we will have to resubmit our <br/>fingerprints at the cost of at least 140.00 and possibly, 160.00, as well as our I-<br/>171H forms too, at the cost of at least almost 600 to the newly proposed 670.00 if <br/>you raise these fees.  Please, it reconsider the fee increase or change the lenght <br/>of time the form is good to at least 24 months.  We do not have limitless funds to <br/>resubmit form after form.  We are just a normal family who would like a child.  <br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802193ef", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-26T16:00:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-26T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-25T01:22:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Loretta A.
