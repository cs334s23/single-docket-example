We have just brought home our second child from Korea <br/>and the expense of this process is making it unaffordable to people that can not <br/>have a child through the birthing process.  <br/><br/>In our process, the government states that as soon as the adoption is final, the <br/>child automatically becomes a citizen of the United States.  However, for whatever <br/>reason we are required to pay a fee to change the records of our children from <br/>Permanent Resident to Citizen of the US.  So the fact that you also want to <br/>increase the fees for a child that is already a citizen is ridiculous.  <br/><br/>I would like you to reconsider the proposal to increase these fees.  Maybe some <br/>consideration should be made to exclude US citizens that are adopting children <br/>from abroad and apply the fees to citizens of other countries that want to <br/>immigrate to the US and become citizens.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>Carol S.
