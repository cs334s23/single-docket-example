As we all know, China adoptions <br/>have slowed down considerably. As I move forward with my second adoption, i am <br/>frustrated with the wait times also. As much as we parents are pushing the <br/>agencies to push the government to get the adoptions done before the I600A form <br/>is expired, I feel that we should not be penalized. If you need to raise the cost, <br/>that might be understandable, but, then the time frame should change for <br/>expiration, or there needs to be a discounted cost for reapplication. Thanks for <br/>hearing the voices of adoptive parents!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dc6b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:20:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T15:29:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ellen Rathke", "trackingNbr": "8021dc6b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2531/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2531/attachments"}}}}}
