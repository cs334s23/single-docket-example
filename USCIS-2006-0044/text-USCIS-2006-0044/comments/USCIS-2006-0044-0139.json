I fully support the right of immigrants to better their lives, but it is sad <br/>that it is so difficult for them to become citizens and for most people, it is <br/>hopeless. Many immigrants come to this country because their own is so poverty-<br/>stricken that they would rather clean houses or perform day labor than try to earn <br/>a living in their home countries. And since the legal avenues of becoming citizens <br/>are largely unavailable to the poor who cannot pay the fees, speak English or <br/>perhaps even read in any language, they are forced to endanger their lives by <br/>crossing the desert on foot just to make minimum wage. How can they possibly <br/>hope to ever raise $1000 when they are killing themselves to make $5.00/hour or <br/>less? This is only going to put citizenship out of reach for more individuals, thus <br/>raising the possibility that more immigrants will cross the border illegally and <br/>unsafely. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa281", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T16:05:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T22:27:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Adrienne", "trackingNbr": "801fa281", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0139/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0139/attachments"}}}}}
