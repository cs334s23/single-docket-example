International adoption waiting times have been <br/>significantly increasing the past 18 months for a variety of overseas programs and <br/>most families are finding that they need to renew at least once, if not twice, during <br/>the wait.  An increase in price, especially such a huge increase, would be more <br/>palatable if the validity of the I171-H was extended to at least 24 months. <br/><br/>Further, the requirement that for renewal of an I171-H, fingerprints must be taken <br/>again is ridiculous at best, simply redundant at worst.  Once the fingerprints are <br/>taken for the initial application, they need to be made readily retrievable until the <br/>adoption is complete and used again at the FBI, if necessary.  Fingerprints do not <br/>change and requiring adoptive families to, sometimes, travel great distances for a <br/>second round of fingerprinting for a renewal is tedious and unacceptable.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219f49", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:53:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T21:16:59Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Karen A.
