(USCIS)<br/>rule that would dramatically raise immigration application fees.<br/><br/>Under the current proposal, an application for permanent residency (green card)<br/>would increase from $325 to $905 and a citizenship application would virtually<br/>double from $330 to $595. Numerous other fees, including fingerprinting, will<br/>increase as well. <br/><br/>These prices, coupled with the long waiting periods to obtain legal residency,<br/>make it extremely difficult for immigrants to obey the law and work legally. <br/>Just as an example, in 1988 we began the process to obtain a green card for a<br/>woman whom we wanted to hire as a nanny for our children, the youngest of whom<br/>was a newborn.  Our daughter was 10 before the approval finally came through!<br/><br/>I believe that a better approach is the Citizenship Promotion Act recently<br/>introduced by U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Senator Barack Obama<br/>(D-IL) and Congressman Luis Gutierrez (D-IL).  This Act would prohibit the USCIS<br/>from raising immigration service fees until the USCIS has studied and reported<br/>the need for the increases to Congress; it authorizes Congress to appropriate<br/>funds to the USCIS for the immigration application process so that immigrants<br/>are not forced to bear the entire cost of their application, and will also<br/>expedite the application process by supporting efforts to educate immigrants<br/>about the legal citizenship process, making electronic filing voluntary and<br/>requesting a Government Accountability Office investigation into delays into the<br/>background check process.<br/><br/>In light of this pending legislation and the hardship your new fee structure<br/>would place on those trying to do the right thing, I urge you NOT to pass the<br/>rule raising the fees.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef19", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:03:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T18:51:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Linda Black", "trackingNbr": "8021ef19", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2810/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2810/attachments"}}}}}
