Congress should support at least <br/>part of expenses for USCIS. It is unfair and may against the basic spirit of the <br/>USA constitution that goverment only collects money from immgrants-to-be and <br/>do not provide any service. If so, it will commerciallized the appearance of USA;<br/><br/>(2)FBI name chekc is a real bottleneck of expediting the LPR or citizenship <br/>applications. There is a increasing backlog at FBI name check. Only increasing <br/>fee for USCIS will have little effect on the speeding the applicationS. Congress <br/>should work out a new way witH FBI and USCS to speed up the name check <br/>process;<br/><br/>(3) Illegal border crossing is a real threatening to this country, of who may have <br/>terrorists. USCIS, FBI and other govermental agencies should foucs on checking <br/>them for improving homeland security. They illegally live and work here. But <br/>nobody cares while some policitians advocate to legalized them. On the contrary, <br/>all legal immgrants-to-be came to this coutry with legal visas. They pay taxes and <br/>now have to pay much more money for the EADs, visa applications, petitons and <br/>adjustment applications. It seems that this country is encouaging illegal activitiies <br/>and put a heavy yoke all the legal ones.   <br/> <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021442c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-16T18:17:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-16T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-15T18:26:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021442c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1281/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1281/attachments"}}}}}
