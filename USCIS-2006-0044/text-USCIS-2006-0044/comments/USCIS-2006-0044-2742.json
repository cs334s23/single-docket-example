I can&#39;t believe the <br/>demands of an adoption are that much more expensive than they were in 2000 <br/>when I adopted.  In this area, I think the government should want to help their <br/>citizens as much as possible:  they will be responsible for countless fees <br/>already.  In addition, as a single mom, the fee raises might pose a hardship that <br/>would be better served in medically helping or educating their new child - this new <br/>American.
