This increase<br/>is totally unfair to families who have paid thousands of dollars to adopt<br/>children who need loving homes.  <br/><br/>There are certainly other avenues for the government to make money, such as<br/>taxing corporations and/or changing tax breaks for the wealthy.  Most families<br/>who go through the arduous process of (foreign) adoption are middle class who do<br/>not have a luxury lifestyle.  <br/><br/>These rates are simply unfair and need to be revisited BEFORE the suggested rate<br/>hike is implemented.  Adoption is an expensive process, and it is unconscionable<br/>to raise fees by up to 66% for adoption-related petitions.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cb8b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:01:19Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T12:36:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jane Salinger", "trackingNbr": "8021cb8b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2272/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2272/attachments"}}}}}
