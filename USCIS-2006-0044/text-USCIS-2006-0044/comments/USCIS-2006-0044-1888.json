My wife and I are in the process of adopting a baby from China.  As <br/>you may know, the adoption time went from 6 months to 12+ months over the last <br/>year which has already caused extra stress, disappointment, etc. for many <br/>adopting families.  Not only this emotional burden has had to be dealt with, but <br/>also due to the extension of adoptive children several of the documentation and <br/>procedures have expired causing addition expenses to families adopting such <br/>children.  To now see such a petition to raise such fees by the Federal Gov. is to <br/>say the least disappointing yet again.  We are adopting 1 or 2 children from China <br/>with hopes and dreams to provide them a much better life than they would have in <br/>China by being abandoned.  Such petitions will only make it more difficult for <br/>people such as us to live such of a dream due to continue expenses going up from <br/>where they were a few years ago.  Adoption is already a very expensive process <br/>and this only steers and lessens the families in the USA that will be able to afford <br/>to do this now and into the future.<br/><br/>Your re-consideration is very much appreciated,<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a96e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:58:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T19:09:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021a96e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1888/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1888/attachments"}}}}}
