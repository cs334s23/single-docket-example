We are <br/>awaiting travel on our last two children.  The increase in costs on a personally level <br/>is disheartening.  We are already scraping everything we have and then some to <br/>bring home our children.  The current fees are already absurdly high for families <br/>willing to give a child a home who would never know the joy and love of growing in <br/>a safe, loving environment.  <br/><br/>As a country, we should be ashamed. Are we going to punish immigrants who are <br/>trying to enter our country legally by increasing already high fees?  We want to try <br/>to eliminate illegal entry and promote following the laws.  By increasing fees, you <br/>are discriminating against the poor immigrants. Should only the rich have access <br/>on our country?<br/><br/>Most assuredly, this is discrimination against future US children.  Should adoptive <br/>parents have to pay more money on top of all the paperwork, waiting, and the <br/>many fees just to bring home their children. This is blatant discrimination against <br/>our internationally adopted children and their families!  We are US Citizens, who <br/>are obeying the law and following all the rules, to yet still be shoved down by our <br/>government.<br/><br/>I plead with you on a moral basis not to pass this proposal.  It is not the right thing <br/>to do. Please, do the right thing for these children.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b6e4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:26:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T20:56:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sarah K.
