I oppose the fee increases and believe <br/>that USCIS should be required to start over in its calculation of fee increases.  <br/><br/>While an increase in filing fees may be necessary, it is incredible that USCIS is <br/>planning to increase fees in some cases by approximately 275% (I-485).  This is <br/>an extreme fee increase, particularly as many of those affected often have <br/>little money to handle such increase as they already are working hard to start a <br/>new life in the U.S.   While many employers will be able to pay the increased fees, <br/>these higher employment costs will undoubtedly be passed on to U.S. consumers <br/>by higher prices.  <br/><br/>Moreover, this reflects poor planning and strategy on the part of USCIS at at time <br/>when the United States needs immigrant workers, particularly low-skilled workers <br/>who earn less and have less ability to pay such high filing fees.  <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9b3b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:57:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T08:17:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kirsten K.
