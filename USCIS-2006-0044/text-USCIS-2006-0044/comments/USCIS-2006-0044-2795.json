The cost to apply for families is currently $545.00 with additional <br/>finger printing, documentation, and administrative costs. We believe a rise in costs <br/>for this process puts an unjust financial burden on families already making a <br/>significant financial commitment to the international adoption process.  <br/>Additionally, the emotional strain of waiting for an international adoption to go <br/>through does not need the added stress financial of issues.<br/><br/>Families willing to provide a loving home to an orphan deserve to have the process <br/>run as smoothly and as economically as possible.  It is the least we can do for <br/>those who are willing to make such a commitment.  <br/><br/>Therefore, a raise in the costs for international adoption is unacceptable and <br/>should be stopped.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration,<br/><br/>Larry and Jennifer Shell<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ee8c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T17:54:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Joe Knollenberg", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Larry Shell", "trackingNbr": "8021ee8c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2795/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2795/attachments"}}}}}
