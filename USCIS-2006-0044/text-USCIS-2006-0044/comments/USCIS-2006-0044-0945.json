According to <br/>the Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2004, <br/>21.6% of  foreign born, non-citizen population has money income below the <br/>poverty line and the median income for this group is $34,497 - significantly below <br/>the median for foreign-born householders who are citizens ($39,421), native <br/>households ($45,319) and naturalized citizens ($46,233). <br/><br/>In this proposed regulation, the increases in fees for permanent residency by <br/>178% to $905 and naturalization by 80% to $595 puts an excessive and unfair <br/>economic burden on a disadvantaged population. It will serve as a disincentive for <br/>immigrants to come to our country and for those already here, it will serve as an <br/>obstacle to changing their status.<br/><br/>The U.S. Congress and the USCIS must find ways to fund immigrant services so <br/>that they are available and are affordable to those that need them. Excessive fees <br/>coupled with a focus on law enforcement acts to criminalize and create untold <br/>hardships for immigrants and their families. We need policies that support <br/>immigrant families, that recognizes the important role they play in our national <br/>economy and that work to incorporate immigrants as full members of our <br/>communities. Anything less is both a disservice to immigrants and a disservice to <br/>ourselves. <br/><br/>http://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/p60-229.pdf<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bc59", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T20:22:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T18:31:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Scott Jenkins", "trackingNbr": "8020bc59", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0945/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0945/attachments"}}}}}
