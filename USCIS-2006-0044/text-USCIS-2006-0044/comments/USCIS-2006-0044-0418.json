We have adopted two and are beginning the process <br/>for #3.  The total fee of $685 is significant enough for this paperwork.  Now we face the prospect of <br/>having it redone during the wait for our child...another $685.  We don&#39;t this kind of money budgeted <br/>for our adoption.  If the fees really do need to increase, a suggestion is to make a cheaper <br/>reapplication option if the adoption is not complete prior to the expiration of the original date on the <br/>I600A...even a 50% discount is a huge help - especially if hte initial fee is increased.  I understand <br/>redoing the fingerprint/check after so many months, but there have to be other options out there.  <br/>Thank you.<br/>Chris Kramer<br/>wife to Scott, mom to 3 - one in heaven, two from China.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206bdd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T00:53:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T00:17:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Chris Kramer", "trackingNbr": "80206bdd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0418/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0418/attachments"}}}}}
