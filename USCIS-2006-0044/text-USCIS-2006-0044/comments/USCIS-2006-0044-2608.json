The fees for adoption should be held at <br/>their current level because, for many of us, we have to file TWICE since the <br/>approval is only good for 18 months. With adoptions taking longer and longer, <br/>most of us have to file twice, paying the FULL PRICE again for services that were <br/>initially invalid by the time the adoption finally happens.<br/><br/>As I understand it, the fee for the I600A will go from $545 to $670, which is an <br/>excessive, and most families have to pay this twice.  Fingerprinting fees are <br/>supposed to be increased as well.<br/><br/>As if that weren&#39;t enough, applying for the children?s Certificate of Citizenship (for <br/>IR4 visas) is proposed to increase from $215 to $460, a difference of $245 or a <br/>whopping 120% increase!  As hopeful adoptive parents, I can attest that we <br/>cannot afford these increases, and I respectfully submit that they do not reflect <br/>anything even vaguely resembling the inflation rate.  <br/><br/>My wife and I beg you to reconsider, for our sake and the sake of the children who <br/>so desperately need good homes.<br/><br/>Thank you for you consideration, <br/>Patrick Lonowski<br/>Claudia Lonowski-Munoz<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dfac", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T02:00:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Patrick Lonowski", "trackingNbr": "8021dfac", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2608/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2608/attachments"}}}}}
