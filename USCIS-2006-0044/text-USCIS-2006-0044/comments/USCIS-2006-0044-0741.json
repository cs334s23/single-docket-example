Such fees will have precisely the opposite effect of what <br/>many want, which is to see residents become citizens. Those of you who <br/>designed the changes would appear to have absolutely no understanding of what <br/>$700 fees look like to people struggling to survive on oftentimes minimum wage <br/>jobs. At the very least you could consider a needs-based fee. If current fees do not <br/>provide adequate resources, I suggest we begin looking not at potential citizens <br/>but at the excessive tax cuts that have helped create the enormous budget deficit <br/>we are facing. <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ellen Bigler<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802095de", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:48:25Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-19T21:44:05Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ellen Bigler", "trackingNbr": "802095de", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0741/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0741/attachments"}}}}}
