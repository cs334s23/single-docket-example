We are in the process of adopting a foreign child and thought <br/>the fees to be high as they are.  If you must increase the cost, an increase of 10-<br/>15% would be much more acceptable and in line with other agency and business <br/>increases.  I don&#39;t think I have ever heard of an increase of this magnitude at one <br/>time before in any type of business.  We do not expect the government to pay for <br/>our adoption nor do we think they should pay for other applications, but we do feel <br/>you should be more reasonable in your increase.<br/>John &amp; Sandra Gavin<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e45", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:09:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sandra Gavin", "trackingNbr": "80219e45", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1687/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1687/attachments"}}}}}
