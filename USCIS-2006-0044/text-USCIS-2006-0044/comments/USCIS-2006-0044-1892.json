As an in <br/>process adoptive parent, we have already paid once for our I-600A and will need to <br/>pay again in eighteen months due to the long wait to adopt from China. We will <br/>already be spending upwards of $15,000 on fees relating to our country and our <br/>agency on the US side. That is not including any fees from China. It is already <br/>extremely expensive to adopt a needy child. We will already be paying the <br/>expensive USCIS fees twice for our adoption. Any increases to the current fees <br/>will make it even more unaffordable to adopt a child. Please do not increase the <br/>current fees.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a9a4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:58:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T19:26:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kristen L.
