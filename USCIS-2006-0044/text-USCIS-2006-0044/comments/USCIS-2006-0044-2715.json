Of special concern is the increase in<br/>fees for I-600/600A, N-565 and N-600.  <br/><br/>The proposed increases represent a major increase to the existing fees.  Many<br/>people undertaking the adoption process will be affected by not only one but<br/>perhaps all three of these fee increases.  The total increase for these three<br/>fees is over 30%.<br/><br/>While I understand the need for increases due to passage of time or due to new<br/>security regulations these increases seem out of line for those requirements. <br/>Especially considering the fees associated with the I-600and I-600A are being<br/>paid by United States citizens in the process of adopting.   <br/><br/>Further raising the fees for the N-600 and N-565 not only places a burden on<br/>parents adopting children (who wish to have the child?s name changed), it also<br/>places a burden on persons attempting to become citizens or who have become<br/>citizens but have lost or destroyed their previous certificates.  It especially<br/>places a burden on women who may wish to change their name at the time of marriage.<br/><br/>With the recent debate regarding immigration it seems counterproductive to make<br/>it more difficult for persons to follow the rules and to use the legal process.  <br/><br/>In closing while understand the need for fee increases as needed these increases<br/>seem excessive.  I urge you to reconsider these increases and the burden that<br/>they will place on families and people who wish to become citizens of this great<br/>country.  <br/><br/>Thank you<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e6fe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:40:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T02:28:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Stacie Lucero", "trackingNbr": "8021e6fe", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2715/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2715/attachments"}}}}}
