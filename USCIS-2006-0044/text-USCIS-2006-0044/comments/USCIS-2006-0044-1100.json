I think continuing to raise fees at the level stated here <br/>are a bit excessive. And what about the duplication of efforts when parents must <br/>be fingerprinted by the State of Michigan as well as being fingerprinted by the <br/>USCIS as well. Streamlining services is one benefit, however, paying a 60% <br/>increase in fees in one year does not appear to be justified.<br/>Thank you,<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Shelley<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480210708", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T18:52:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-09T03:52:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Dingell", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Shelley Van Riper", "trackingNbr": "80210708", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1100/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1100/attachments"}}}}}
