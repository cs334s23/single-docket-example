The burden of having to refile for a valid I-171H is both costly <br/>and emotionally draining for us.  We also have to be refingerprinted (extra cost).  <br/>An I-171H should be valid for at least two years (we think it should be valid through <br/>bringing our new child home from China.  Fingerprints do not change within 15 <br/>months.  It&#39;s not morally right to raise the rates of a new I-600A and fingerprints.  <br/>It&#39;s bad enough that we have to get new fingerprints and an I 171H, PLEASE do <br/>not raise the rates even higher than what they are right now.  Our I-171H and <br/>fingerprints should still be valid as we are not home with our beautiful new child <br/>yet.  All of us parents adopting are praying you do not raise the rates, as our old <br/>ones should still be valid.  Thank you so much for your attention to this matter.<br/><br/>Scott and Cheryl Davis<br/>Colorado Springs, Colorado<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208070", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T18:25:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T03:31:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cheryl A.
