At the same time, if I were to implement up <br/>to a 66% increase in my fees for services, I would go out of business because my <br/>customers would go somewhere else. <br/>Perhaps we need to evaluate this case in the same way. There are many families <br/>in the US that are excited about adopting domestically or internationally but a <br/>huge roadblock is in front of them when they learn about the costs. Children all <br/>over the country and the world need a home, a family and a chance at life. We are <br/>prepared to give it to them but the cost is becoming increasingly burdensome to <br/>the point of crushing the hopes and dreams of families being created in our <br/>blessed country. <br/>I ask that you reconsider these fee increases from both a logical and a caring <br/>perspective. Must we increase the fees and set up more roadblocks for adoption? <br/>What if it was you waiting for a home or a family or a chance at life? What if you <br/>never were chosen? Not because of your worth but because it just couldn&#39;t be <br/>afforded?<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a890", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:53:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:28:50Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Esther W.", "trackingNbr": "8021a890", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1844/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1844/attachments"}}}}}
