The fact<br/>is that many of the U.S&#39;s prospective adopting parents put their lives on hold<br/>for many, many months, sometimes even years, to bring home their children.  Most<br/>of those parents wipe themselves financially dry attempting to afford the<br/>already steep fees associated with international adoption.  Increasing those<br/>fees paid to this agency will only do more to support the belief that<br/>international adoption is unattainable for the average family.  There is no<br/>conceivable reason for these fees to be raised in such a manner.  Unless you&#39;re<br/>willing to offer a I-600a that does not expire in 18months, or finger-prints<br/>that do not need to be retaken after 15months, along with these fees, this is an<br/>sad excuse to exploit adopting families.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b729", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:27:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T21:38:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Nicole S.
