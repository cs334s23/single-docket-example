I am married to a Ukrainian citizen, and was required to pay fees of <br/>$170 for a petition for fiancee, along with $70.00 for biometrics fee.  After marrying <br/>I had to apply for alien registration $350.00 + $70.00 for biometrics fee again, <br/>because of delays in the process I was told that it was over a year since the <br/>original fingerprints were taken, and so they had to be taken again.  So far it has <br/>cost $660.00 X 2 because my wife has a minor son who accompanied her to the <br/>United States.  This summer I will have to pay again for an adjustment of status <br/>and probably the biometrics again which at the moment the fees are $350.00 + <br/>$70.00 X 2 = $840.00.  So in order to marry a non U.S. citizen and bring her and <br/>her son to the United States will cost me in excess of  $1080.00 X 2 = $2,160.00 <br/>and that is just to become a legal resident.  If these fees go into effect, then the <br/>government should provide an itemized invoice to show where the funds were <br/>appropriated.  How many background investigations does the government need to <br/>do on an individual.  The costs for followup investigations due to adjusting status <br/>should not cost the same as an original background check, therefore making the <br/>increase in all fees disproportionate<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9a77", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:31:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T02:04:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By John J.
