If an <br/>applicant, who&#39;s dedicated to following the Golden Rules, happens to fail on the <br/>first try of taking the test, will that person have to pay again? If yes, that&#39;s just <br/>ridiculous! Have we taken into consideration that perhaps there are so many <br/>undocumented immigrants because they simply can&#39;t afford to do the right thing, <br/>the right way because they can barely scrape enough money to survive? Will <br/>applicants actually get better service, meaning faster and sufficient response? I&#39;m <br/>so disgusted by so-called Americans who blame immigrants for their tax <br/>problems. I&#39;ve been in deportation status since the age of 5. I&#39;m now 23, and just <br/>received my work authorization last year, and I&#39;m paying tax too! I don&#39;t mind that <br/>my parents&#39; and my tax money is going to help baby boomers with social security <br/>and other good causes or that it?s helping non-immigrants who depend on welfare. <br/>There&#39;s a thing call ?tax refund? and ?caring about others? too! This nation was built <br/>by immigrants and it will continue to stay that way! Where there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a <br/>way! If your intention of increasing the fee is to control amount of applicants, then <br/>this nation will face more hate crimes and immigration issues. Please do not <br/>increase the fee and thank you for your time.<br/><br/>yours truly,<br/>Caroline Vang<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020940b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:45:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-17T04:41:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Caroline Vang", "trackingNbr": "8020940b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [{"id": "0900006480dff8c8", "type": "attachments"}], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0708/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0708/attachments"}}}}, "included": [{"id": "0900006480dff8c8", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/0900006480dff8c8"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": "Attachment on USCIS-2006-0044-DRAFT-0711", "docOrder": 1, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCIS-2006-0044-0708/attachment_1.doc", "format": "doc", "size": 25088}], "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T10:45:52Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Caroline Vang (Attachment)"}}]}
