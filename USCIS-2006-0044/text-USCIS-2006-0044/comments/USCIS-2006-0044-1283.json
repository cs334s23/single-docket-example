Through no fault of our own, the process for our adoption has stretched <br/>from the predicted 8-10 month wait to at least a 20 month wait.  During this time, <br/>our paperwork will have surpased its 18 month time limit and we will need to <br/>resubmit all applications in order to bring our child home.  <br/>There have been many requests and opportunities for the government to extend <br/>the exipiration of our documents, yet that option has not been pursued.  Now to <br/>increase the cost to renew forms that we are required to submit is adding insult to <br/>injury.  This process is costly enough without the added pressure of form renewal, <br/>and all of the associated charges that will go with that.  <br/>Please reconsider increasing the fees and think of the citizens who you are <br/>supposed to be serving.  To avoid the &quot;need&quot; for higher fee schedules, simply <br/>extend the time limit that our original paperwork is valid.  Less work for the USCIS <br/>employees, less cost for the government, less cost to your citizens who have <br/>already jumped through all of the necessary hoops once, and are about to get <br/>nailed in our wallets because we have to do it again.<br/>Thank you,<br/>Amelia Mowery<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802144e5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-16T18:17:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-16T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-15T20:14:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Amelia G.
