These <br/>proposed fees would place a significant hurdle and burden on immigrants desiring to <br/>enter this country thru legal means. While I can appreciate the need for increased <br/>revenues in processing applications, the cost for this should be borne by US <br/>taxpayers, not fully by immigrants alone. I would prefer to see the fees remain at the <br/>current schedule and any additional costs be subsidized by taxpayers. These <br/>proposed fees are unfair and burdensome for new immigrants. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480209558", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:47:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-19T16:19:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jill Wright", "trackingNbr": "80209558", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0732/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0732/attachments"}}}}}
