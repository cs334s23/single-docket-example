We have already paid <br/>the fee once as we are adopting a child from China and will have to pay this fee a <br/>second time due to the length of time the  adoptions are taking.I don&#39;t like having <br/>to  pay for it twice much less knowing the price is going up. It would be very <br/>helpful if you would extend the period of time the application is good for.Money <br/>taken from the family is money that could be spent better on our children.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020d5fc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-02T19:04:23Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-02T17:47:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michael E.
