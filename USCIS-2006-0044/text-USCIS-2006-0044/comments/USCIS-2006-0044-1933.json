The only way we can have children is through adoption.  When we <br/>started researching adoption we were stunned at the cost.  At times, we wonder <br/>how we will come up with the remaining amount that we still owe.  We would love <br/>to have more than one child but this is probably not an option due to the cost.  <br/><br/>It is a shame that everyone has their hand out for money throughout the adoption <br/>process.  If it was not so expensive we may be able to provide more, less <br/>fortunate children with loving homes.  The average family can not afford adopting <br/>as it is and to increase the fees by up to 66% is dispicable.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab31", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:58:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T23:13:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kelly R.
