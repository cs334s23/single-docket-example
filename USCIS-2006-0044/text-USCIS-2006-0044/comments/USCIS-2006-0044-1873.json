We are an enlisted family so <br/>our income is not fantastic.  So far in our adoption we have had to apply for the I-600a <br/>twice plus pay for the social worker to travel for the original homestudy and to update <br/>the homestudy once due to a change of duty station.  This increase would do more <br/>harm to families in our situation.  Please reconsider raising the fees or at the minimum <br/>make the I-600a only a one time fee so the document is good until the adoption is <br/>completed. <br/>Such a drastic increase in citizenship would also hurt adopting families since we <br/>already have the cost of the immigration forms and the travel to pick up our children.  <br/>Many families would not be able to afford such an important part of the adoption.  It <br/>would be a horrible thing not to be able to afford after all is said and done.  <br/>Perhaps a smaller increase would be just as beneficial for your department and not so <br/>out of reach for us average people. <br/>Thank you for your time. <br/>E Shore<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a82f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:56:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T16:51:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Elouise Shore", "trackingNbr": "8021a82f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1873/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1873/attachments"}}}}}
