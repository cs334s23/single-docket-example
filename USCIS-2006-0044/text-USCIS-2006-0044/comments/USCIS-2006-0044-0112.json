It is understandable that it cost money to do<br/>business, however, the USCIS has been increasing fees without improving their<br/>efficiency.  If this fee hype comes with guarantee that the processing time will<br/>be shortened in proportion to the increase, I&#39;d be ok with it. <br/><br/>P.S.<br/>Now that all the illegal immigrants are taking the street for their rights,  it<br/>seems to me that nobody cares about the rights of legal immigrants.  We abide by<br/>the USCIS rules, pay tax and now a lot of us are stuck in the retrogression. <br/>Shame on USCIS!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9e31", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T18:19:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T15:54:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801f9e31", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0112/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0112/attachments"}}}}}
