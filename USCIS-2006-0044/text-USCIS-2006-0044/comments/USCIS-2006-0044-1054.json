Specifically, as they relate to M-1 status vocational <br/>students and Optional Practical Training (OPT), to which the students are entitled <br/>at the end of their school program.  Currently, the regulations state that M status <br/>students must apply for work authorization on Form I-765 and an extension of <br/>status on Form I-539.  The fees associated with both of these forms are <br/>scheduled to increase dramatically.  However, the benefit that M status students <br/>derive from these applications is limited.  First of all, M students are allowed 4 <br/>weeks of OPT for every 4 months of study.  The students at The French Culinary <br/>Institute study for 6 months.  I was informed by USCIS recently that this means <br/>The FCI&#39;s graduates are entitled to 4 weeks of OPT (as opposed to the 6 weeks I <br/>had thought they were entitled to).  The Social Security Agency, as one of my <br/>students recently discovered, will only issue social security numbers for work <br/>authorization that is longer than one month.  The practical outcome of these <br/>rulings is that graduates of The FCI - and of other schools with similar time <br/>frames - are unable to take advantage of OPT despite the fact that they are clearly <br/>entitled to it.  Additionally, USCIS offices do not seem to be clear on the <br/>regulations regarding M status students.  Several FCI graduates applied for an <br/>extension of status on Form I-539 - as required in the Form I-765 instructions - but <br/>were denied the extensions because, as the Service Center put it, the OPT <br/>application automatically extends their M status so therefore they don&#39;t need to <br/>apply for an extension.  Anecdotally, however, I&#39;ve heard of another Service Center <br/>that will not approve OPT applications if they are not filed concurrently with <br/>extension of status applications.  I believe that prior to any fee increases, USCIS <br/>needs to be clear - and make it clear to their customers and their advocates - <br/>what the regulations concerning this particular class of students really state and <br/>what the practical outcome of those regulations is.  It seems to me that the <br/>proposed fee increases for this class of students is an undue burden.  I believe the <br/>combined cost of the I-765 and I-539 applications will exceed $600 for a paltry 4 <br/>(6?) weeks of OPT employment authorization.  I understand the need for the fee <br/>increases on the part of USCIS, but I think that the fees should either be <br/>increased in proportion to the ultimate benefit received (that is, raised for F status <br/>students, who can really benefit from OPT and who don&#39;t have to apply for the <br/>extension of status, but not for M status students), or the benefit that M students <br/>receive should be increased proportionate to the fee increase (that is, a longer <br/>OPT period).  In any case, USCIS needs to clarify within its organization what the <br/>rules governing M status students and their dependents are.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020d54c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-02T18:48:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-02T15:30:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Elsa Ransom, The French Culinary Institute", "trackingNbr": "8020d54c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1054/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1054/attachments"}}}}}
