These not only increase the burden to families adopting international, <br/>they are not warranted by the level of poor customer service provided to US <br/>taxpayers.<br/><br/>Despite my fingerprints being on file with the FBI, NSA, and other branches of <br/>government, USCIS would not accept my fingerprints. This required 4 trips over 3 <br/>months, each taking 4 hours. In February 2006 on my 3rd trip, the Norfolk office <br/>moved WITH NO NOTICE and was then shut down for 2 weeks. This caused an 8 <br/>week delay to submitting my paperwork, which in turn contributed to the now 18 <br/>month delay in our adoption.<br/><br/>This 18 month (and growing) delay has prevented me from claiming tax relief and <br/>employer reimbursement, increasing the interest and fees on the $7,000 of loans  <br/>I have spent on adoption costs to date. <br/><br/>This increase in costs is yet another smack to adoptive parents who have already <br/>been beaten by an overly burdensome and costly process, an insensitive <br/>bureaucracy, and changing international rules. While I might support increased <br/>fees if paperwork expirations supported growing timeframes and the services <br/>provided by USCIS to US citizens afforded some reasonable quality of customer <br/>service, my experience to date does not merit any increase in fees.<br/><br/>Please address these issues prior to considering any increase that impacts <br/>adoptive parents. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e4b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:11:59Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Harvey Summers", "trackingNbr": "80219e4b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1689/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1689/attachments"}}}}}
