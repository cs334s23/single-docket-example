While there is a need for <br/>increased numbers of adjudicators, those who will be paying these increase fees at the moment <br/>will not be the ones seeing lowered processing time.  I would be in favor of a graduated fee <br/>increase, where each year the fee is raised.  In addition there is currently a significant discrepency <br/>in processing times between service centers for some visas.  For instance the I-129F is being <br/>processed around 2 months faster through Vermont than through California.  A redistribution of <br/>petitions could also help with processing times.  Overall, a drastic increase in fees immediately <br/>implemented, the effects of which would not be seen for those currently effected makes no sense.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802185c2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-26T15:41:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-26T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-22T19:50:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Holly D.
