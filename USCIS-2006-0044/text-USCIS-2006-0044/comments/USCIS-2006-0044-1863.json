The cost to adopt internationally <br/>is substantial as it is and I feel that an increase in a fee that is already so costly <br/>would be detrimental to others who are considering adoption to increase their <br/>family.  There are so many families who feel called to take part in this wonderful <br/>thing and I ask that you please reconsider raising the fees so that it is not such a <br/>hardship for future families.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a8ff", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:55:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T18:15:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Amber M.
