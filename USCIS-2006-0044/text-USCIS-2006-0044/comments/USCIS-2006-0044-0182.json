My <br/>impression of USCIS operations was in 2004.  My wife had her green card <br/>interview at the district office in Charlotte, NC.  While talking to the interviewing <br/>officer I inquired about the advanced parole travel document, and the permission to <br/>work document that we filed (with appropriate fees) and never received prior to the <br/>interview.  I was told that they were not necessary once my wife received her <br/>green card.  I asked about a refund of the fees, but was quickly told that there <br/>would be no refund.  I rebutted with the fact that I paid (a few hundred dollars) for <br/>something that I did not receive, I didn&#39;t even receive expired paperwork.  You <br/>would have a hard time convincing me that this was anything less than fraud on <br/>your part.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801faae3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-06T14:42:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-06T02:29:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Daniel B.
