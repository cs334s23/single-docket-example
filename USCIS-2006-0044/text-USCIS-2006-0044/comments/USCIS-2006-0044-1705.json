The current fee of $545 dollars to process an I-<br/>600A is ridiculous. The ?service? we have received has been the most unhelpful of <br/>any agency that I have EVER dealt with. I wouldn?t pay $5 for it. We are going on <br/>5 months now waiting for our paperwork to be processed. More than once we have <br/>been requested to submit information in a case study that was already there. <br/><br/>Why don?t you use the money that is currently being generated to invest in some <br/>computers and competent employees? Every time we get a form letter from the <br/>CIS, it is filled with typos and errors. They also don?t offer any help or suggestions <br/>to remedy their perceived problem; no contact information of any kind, outside of <br/>snail mail. No phone numbers, no email addresses, no web sites, nothing. I get <br/>the idea that these people don?t want to be bothered with helping anyone. Are <br/>these the people in charge of protecting me and my family in the United States?  <br/>Maybe instead of worrying about raising rates, you should worry about raising the <br/>QUALITY of service given to those who are already paying an outrageous amount <br/>for it, and not getting it. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219ee0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:52:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:40:43Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80219ee0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1705/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1705/attachments"}}}}}
