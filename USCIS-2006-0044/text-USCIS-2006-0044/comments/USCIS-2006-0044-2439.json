As a laywer who prepares and submits various reports to for clients, the <br/>proposed fee increases places an unfair burden on citizens who must obtain <br/>various USCIS documents in order to travel, to prove citizenship and to adopt. <br/><br/>As our world becomes an increasingly global world and as people begin to <br/>emigrate between countries, user fees should dECREASE, not increase.
