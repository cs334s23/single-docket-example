Admission to the United States should <br/>be based on individual merit, not the ability to pay high fees. These fees are out of <br/>reach of a large percentage of the world&#39;s population. We already have plenty of <br/>rich people who pay less than their fair share--it is by and large the poor <br/>immigrants who have the motivation to do the hard work our country needs. I work <br/>with these people every week teaching English and I know their precarious <br/>financial conditions first hand. We benefit from their intelligence, ambition, and <br/>work ethic already, without having to hold citizenship in our country for ransom.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa20a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T16:05:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T21:00:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Malcolm H.
