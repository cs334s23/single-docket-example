The cost for international adoption is considerable for most<br/>families and in some cases prevents them from going thru the process.  By<br/>increasing the fees, the number of families that can afford to adopt will<br/>decrease.  The end result will be more children staying in orphanages, instead<br/>of being adopted into loving homes.  I ask that you shelf this proposal and<br/>reconsider the increase in fee structure.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e688", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:39:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T01:09:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Shari Hatfield", "trackingNbr": "8021e688", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2705/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2705/attachments"}}}}}
