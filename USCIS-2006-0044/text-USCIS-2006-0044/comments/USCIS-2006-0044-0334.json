Why? Because they have free <br/>schools, free<br/>Medical services, free food stamps etc.  I have heard about people tanking <br/>advantage of the system.  If people have free schools for their children, sure they <br/>can?t pay all these fees expenses to become legal.  Many people abuse the <br/>system.  Legal and illegal people need to learn to give something to this country, <br/>not only take things away from it.   <br/><br/>  I don?t worry about the increased, as long as the money goes to the right <br/>direction.  A lot of people working on government offices give a terrible service.  <br/>They are there only for the big check.<br/><br/>I wish we could have a telephone line where we can report those benchwarmers.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480203907", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-13T14:05:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-13T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-12T23:57:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jennifer Brown", "trackingNbr": "80203907", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0334/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0334/attachments"}}}}}
