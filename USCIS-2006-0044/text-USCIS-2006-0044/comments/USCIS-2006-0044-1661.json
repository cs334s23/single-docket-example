As a parent in the process of adopting an orphan from abroad, I <br/>object to the increase in fees.  Expenses for adoption are high, and the fees from <br/>USCIS are significant, especially when adoptions often take longer than the 18 <br/>months that I-171H allows for.  Quite often pre-adoptive parents will take several <br/>years to complete adoptions, and those that don&#39;t complete before the 18 months <br/>will have to pay all the fees for USCIS multiple times.  Please reconsider <br/>increasing this fee!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219d9c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:36:22Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:24:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80219d9c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1661/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1661/attachments"}}}}}
