I know that not all countries are taking as long as China <br/>but China is the country that we have applied through.  These vital and required <br/>fees have already cost us $685  if you increase your fees our second round that <br/>we will need due to expiration will cost us an additional $830.  I think that a rate <br/>hike of $135 is a lot of money especially when so much is spent on the process <br/>already.  Please evaluate this proposed change and verify that the rate hike is <br/>appropriate and fair.<br/>Thank you,<br/>Tina Kristoff<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020c1cc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-28T16:05:23Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-28T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-27T17:53:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tina M.
