The adoption process is already a very expensive and hard thing to endure. <br/>For many people who adopt internationally, it takes the financial help of friends <br/>and family to help defray the costs to even make it somewhat affordable. Please <br/>also consider the fact that international adoptions are a very long process, and <br/>many times, families have to resubmit applications more than once because the <br/>paperwork has expired. This causes adopting families to pay the fees at least <br/>twice. Thank you for your consideration on this matter.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a812", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:55:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Paul Sinclair", "trackingNbr": "8021a812", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1867/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1867/attachments"}}}}}
