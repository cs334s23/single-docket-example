The cost is so high to begin with to start a <br/>family. Please do not increase the fees and make it harder for those of us who <br/>want children but can not have them naturally to become a family. So many <br/>children are abused and negleted by parents that dont want them. It is a sad that <br/>in this country you have to buy a child for so high a price. Those that want to go <br/>thru the State sometime have to wait for such a long time that they get <br/>discouraged and go overseas like we did. Beacause my husband is serving <br/>overseas in Iraq we were told we would have to wait the 18 months until he <br/>returned home before we could get a child with the State of NC. We have since <br/>applied with an agency to go to China. So much for our State support for adoption <br/>and children with no home. Thanks for your time. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c5ab", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:57:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T00:07:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by L Fine", "trackingNbr": "8021c5ab", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2249/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2249/attachments"}}}}}
