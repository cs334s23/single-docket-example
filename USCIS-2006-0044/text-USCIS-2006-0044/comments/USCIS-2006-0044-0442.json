How can the mandarins in the <br/>USCIS justify such massive fees increases, when the service offered is slow, <br/>unresponsive and at times down right hostile to those who have to use it.<br/>The correlation between price increases and productivity levels is unproven. The <br/>USCIS should be looking for better ways of working and for being fully funded by <br/>the Congress rather than hiding behind price increases which the ordinary person <br/>in the USA would not stand for. If US citizen had to use this service there would be <br/>an outcry throughout the land. During my processing I&#39;ve been made to feel almost <br/>like a criminal, and yet you want to make me pay for for this &#39;privilege&#39;!<br/>If I make a move to become permanent, then you&#39;ll be looking to freeze me out by <br/>way of costs, and no guarantee of a better, smoother system!l <br/>Even with all the correct paperwork, status and visas, getting in and out of the <br/>country without secondary interviews seems like a lottery. But it shouldn&#39;t be so. <br/>Come on legislators, treat potential immigrants with respect and fairness, <br/>streamline the system and speed up the processes, but don&#39;t penalize us by way <br/>of exhorbitant fees, aka a &#39;tax&#39; for having to be processed.<br/>I love the USA, her people and her heritage, but I&#39;m loathe to give my name for fear <br/>of reprisal, how sad!
