America, is and always shall be my home, my place of <br/>birth, and in my heart, but. We cannot better ourselves or the world by simply <br/>asking for more money to &quot;come here&quot;. We want a better economy, but yet we <br/>tell our potential outside the border buisiness that if you really want it well... I <br/>understand the concept; the overpopulation fear. The Risks involved in just letting <br/>any old fool into our borders, but what stops the rest of the world from simply <br/>uniting and boycotting America.
