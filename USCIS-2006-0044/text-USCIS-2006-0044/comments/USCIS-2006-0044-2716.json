We&#39;re thrilled with the <br/>baby, but the fees have really been difficult for her.  It&#39;s hard enough to bring a new <br/>baby home and adjust to diapers and formula.  I&#39;d like to request that you leave <br/>the current fee schedule and not raise prices.  My daughter wants to adopt again, <br/>but with adoption wait times increasing, immigration fees would get very <br/>expensive, especially if the form expires and she has to refile and pay the fees a <br/>second time for the same adoption.<br/>Please don&#39;t increase the fees, I&#39;d like more internationally adopted grandchildren.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e71e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:40:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T02:53:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sue Miller", "trackingNbr": "8021e71e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2716/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2716/attachments"}}}}}
