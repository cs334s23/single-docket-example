Most couples have already spent a great deal of money on medical <br/>expenses to try and have biological children.  For many couples adoption is the <br/>only way to have their own children.  It is a difficult and emotional process, as well <br/>as very expensive.  By wrongly increasing fees for the USCIS services many <br/>couples may not be able to pursue adoption.  This is a terrible thing to know that <br/>someone who wants a family of their own could not have one because the <br/>government charges too much for necessary documents.  The emotional distress <br/>these increases will put on couples trying to adopt could potentially increase the <br/>health care cost for mental, emotional and physical stress.  By making it easier <br/>and less expensive both private and government funds could be saved.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c741", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:01:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T03:47:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by C.
