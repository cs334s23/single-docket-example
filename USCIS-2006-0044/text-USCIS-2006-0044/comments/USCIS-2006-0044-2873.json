If we are truly wanting illegal immigrants to <br/>apply for worker visa status and/or  citizenship then we need to make the process <br/>as easy as possible. <br/>I think banks, credit unions and even grocery store bank branches should be <br/>made into &quot;Immigration offices&quot;.  We need to get pictures, finger prints, driver&#39;s <br/>licenses numbers, social security/tin numbers, phone numbers, addresses, <br/>spousal and child/ren&#39;s information along with next of kin, so that we can begin <br/>the process.  This should have been initiated twenty years ago. <br/>By increasing the fees necessary to obtain this vital information we are in fact <br/>jeopardizing the homeland security we desparately need. <br/>We also need to get ALL countries to sign an agreement that would allow shared <br/>criminal information so that we can track criminals/terrorist both in and out of the  <br/>US!!! <br/>Please consider my comments and do what is best in the national interest !!!!!!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f1b7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:08:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-03T00:38:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Gloria Rodriguez", "trackingNbr": "8021f1b7", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2873/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2873/attachments"}}}}}
