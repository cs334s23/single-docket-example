Adoption has been <br/>such a positive experience for our family.....but we did have a hard time financially <br/>making it happen. I feel that is unconscionable to increase fees - and such a large <br/>amount! - especially for adoption-related petitions. We adopted our daughter from <br/>China, and she has brought so much joy to our family. Now that the wait times for <br/>China are increasing, most families will have to re-do their fingerprints and I-600A <br/>because the originals will expire before a child is assigned. That means they will <br/>be paying over $1600 just for these 2 fees to the US government! It is utterly <br/>ridiculous and just a shame......everything is getting so expensive - the tax on our <br/>home, our electric bill, etc. We will not be able to afford to adopt again. The <br/>increase in fees will be a detriment to those wishing to adopt a child, and an unfair <br/>hardship on some adoptive parents. Please reconsider this increase! Adoption is <br/>SUCH a wonderful thing!!!<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d743", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:17:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T22:09:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent, Kristen Fitzgerald", "trackingNbr": "8021d743", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2441/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2441/attachments"}}}}}
