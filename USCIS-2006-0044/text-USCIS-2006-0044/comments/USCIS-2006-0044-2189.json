With adoptions <br/>generally costing over $20,000, applying a fee increase to international adoptions <br/>will prohibit many couples from growing their families through adoption. The United <br/>States does not have enough babies available for adoption to meet the needs of <br/>infertile couples, so many are adopting internationally. Raising the fees for <br/>international adoptions will further limit the options for infertile couples. Even the <br/>adoption tax credit is not enough to offset this -- the adoption agencies simply <br/>raised their fees so that the end result is adoptive parents paying an enormous <br/>amount of money in order to adopt a child. Adding a baby to your family should be <br/>every person&#39;s fundamental right to do, and yet continued fee increases are <br/>causing couples who are not doctors or lawyers to have to give up on their dream <br/>of becoming parents. Cut the teachers and laborers a break by exempting <br/>adoption from this fee increase.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021bad5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T01:40:22Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T12:16:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Vita Alligood", "trackingNbr": "8021bad5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2189/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2189/attachments"}}}}}
