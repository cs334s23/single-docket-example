I recently received approval for this very petition. My family is not a <br/>wealthy family, and if the fees for adoption were much higher we would not be able <br/>to afford the costs. Any increase, no matter how minimal it may seem, would be <br/>detrimental to so many families that are considering opening their home to a child <br/>that doesn&#39;t have one.<br/><br/>I have read several comments that some have posted about this proposal saying <br/>that they had an unpleasant experience with USCIS. Fortunately, I can say that I <br/>was very pleased with the timeframe in which the Atlanta office handled our case. <br/>However, the first approval letter that we received had the incorrect name on it. <br/>When we contacted that Atlanta office to tell them of this error, we informed them <br/>that this name was not on our application, nor was it on our birth certificate. We <br/>were in turn called liars. When we sent the information to the office that proved we <br/>were telling the truth, our corrected approval letter was sent remarkably quickly! I <br/>know that this isn&#39;t the place to complain about these things, but I believe that the <br/>fees we pay for these filings should include some service, and I must say the fee <br/>that we paid was not worth being called a liar. Thank you for your time.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ec97", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T14:25:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T14:41:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Gerald Cochrane II", "trackingNbr": "8021ec97", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2756/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2756/attachments"}}}}}
