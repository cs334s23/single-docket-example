These rate incrases are beyond any fair and justifiable rate; they are exorbitant <br/>and entirely unfair, given that many people coming here seeking citizenship often hold lower-wage <br/>jobs and positions and are often trying to send as much money back home to their countries of <br/>origin as possible to support their families. The unjustice propsed in this docket will not do anything <br/>to fix any of the problems currently facing our countrys&#39; immigration services, but instead represent <br/>the current anti-immigrant climate so prevelant in our nation today. I am asking all elected officials <br/>to vote against this impractical and unfair measure.
