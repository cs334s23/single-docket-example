It is already costing almost $20,000 to bring our little girl home and we <br/>are doing everything we can to do this without killing ourselves.  I understand that the <br/>adoption process is expensive (BELIEVE ME!!!!) but I cannot see that the cost of  <br/>processing a piece of paperwork can increase 66%.  This is absolutely rediculous to <br/>even believe that you feel that the cost of adoption is increasing at a higher rate than <br/>utilities and OIL!!!  Please reconsider your decision to make the adoption process more <br/>expensive!  There are so many families out there who desire a family and so many <br/>children that NEED a family.  DO NOT increase the price so much that you stop this <br/>from happening!  <br/><br/>Very Concerned,<br/><br/>Patrick Harrington<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ec52", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T14:24:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T14:08:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Patrick Harrington", "trackingNbr": "8021ec52", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2749/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2749/attachments"}}}}}
