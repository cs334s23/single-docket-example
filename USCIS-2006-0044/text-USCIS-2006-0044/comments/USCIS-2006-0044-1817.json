Adoption is a process that requires a huge emotional investment as well <br/>as financial. While the proposal appears to be a minor increase please keep in <br/>mind that total adoption costs can exceed $30,000. Not only that but many <br/>families may have to pay these fees TWICE depending on referral wait time for the <br/>countries that they are working with because of expiration dates. Which is also <br/>ridiculous considering fingerprinting. Why would our fingerprints expire? They don&#39;t <br/>change. <br/><br/>As a parent and a former prospective adoptive parent, I would never support fee <br/>increases for adoption costs whether implemented by the governments involved or <br/>the agencies involved. In fact, it should be much easier.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a666", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:50:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T13:44:43Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Olivia J.
