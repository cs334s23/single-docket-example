As a family currently going through an <br/>international adoption, the costs are already high enough. We (the families that <br/>have adopted, are adopting and thinking of adopting) have so many hurdles to go <br/>over that changing these fees will just add to the stress that we already have to go <br/>through. Increasing these costs may make the difference between adopting a <br/>child and creating a family, or foregoing adoption for many families. Please <br/>reconsider this regulation and the effects that it will have on the many people who <br/>are considering adoption as the only means to have a family.<br/>Thank you<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a076", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:03:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:48:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sara B.
