The vast <br/>majority of people who are adopting internationally have already gone through very <br/>expensive fertility treatments and have turned to adoption as their last chance to <br/>be parents.  The wait time for parents adopting from China has increased to <br/>approximately 2 years for the entire adoption process.  China is the most popular <br/>country to adopt from because of it&#39;s stable adoption program and a better chance <br/>at getting healthy babies.  However, most applicants will have to re-file their I-600A <br/>due to long wait times in China recently.  Families who have already paid more <br/>than they can afford on fertility treatments are now having to pay the U.S. <br/>government twice for refiling the I-600A form.  Increasing the fees makes the whole <br/>situation more grim for people who are already strapped for cash.  Please don&#39;t <br/>punish people who are simply trying to become parents.
