This adds a <br/>huge financial burden to families who are already financially stretched thin by the <br/>whole cost of adoption.  The proposal to raise current I-600A related cost for <br/>Biometrics and filing the form by nearly $150 per couple is worrisome.  Again, with <br/>the current predicted wait times, most families will need to refile once.  Some <br/>families may need to refile twice.  Per filing, that calculates out to $685 at the <br/>current fees and to $830 with the proposed fee hike.  This is in addition to the <br/>$685 that was already submitted with the original filing.  If a family needs to refile <br/>twice, at the proposed fee schedule, that would be another $1660 for a total of  <br/>$2345 in filing fees for just the I-600A form alone.  This is an enormous amount of <br/>money for families to be burdened with.  For the sake of the children in need of <br/>forever families and for the sake of the families who so desparately want to bring <br/>their children home, please reconsider and do NOT implement the fee increase <br/>proposal.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c3ac", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:51:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T19:58:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Mai Phung", "trackingNbr": "8021c3ac", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2237/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2237/attachments"}}}}}
