Currently, the processing time for an international adoption is <br/>longer than the life of the I-171H form.  My husband and I completed our I-600A in <br/>December 2005 and, not having even finalized the adoption we were approved for, <br/>are having to redo the same paperwork as it will expire before our first child is <br/>placed with us.<br/><br/>Looking at the proposal posted on-line, the government is not planning on seeing <br/>an increase in workload volume on either the I-600 or I-600A.  Such adoption-<br/>related petitions are also taking a limited amount of processing time compared to <br/>other applications the USCIS deals with.  Most applicants (adoptive families) have <br/>already been through 3-4 months of detailed paperwork/screening before filing with <br/>the USCIS and their applications will be easy to process as they&#39;ve been guided <br/>by their respective agencies on the proper way to submit such forms.<br/><br/>The proposed increase in adoption-related fees by 66% unfairly targets families <br/>who are already bearing an expensive burnden and, most likely, are interested in <br/>pursuing more than one adoption to complete their families.  Such drastic changes <br/>in fees is likely to discourage those who have already taken a financial hit to <br/>complete one adoption.<br/><br/>Please reconsider the increase, or amount of increase, in adoption-related <br/>petitions in an effort to support those families who are willing to provide a safe, <br/>nuturing, and loving home to some of the world&#39;s abandoned children.
