I understand there is pressure to increase fees, but your proposed amounts<br/>are way too steep in too short a time.  And the fees are unfair.<br/><br/>2. Increased scrutiny and checking time obviously costs more. But this is a<br/>U.S. security decision that benefits all U.S. citizens -- therefore, they<br/>should pay for a portion of costs.  Immigration petitioners (and indirectly <br/>U.S. citizen sponsors) should not bear this burden alone. It is not fair.<br/><br/>3. Also, additional department costs, such as refugee or asylum surcharges <br/>that have nothing to do with immigrants, should clearly NOT be borne <br/>by immigrants. From 8 CFR Part 103, &quot;Since USCIS is funded from <br/>application fees, a fee waiver transfers the cost to all other fee-paying<br/>applicants.&quot;  This is fundamentally unfair and there is NO justification<br/>for this practice.  If the government (and general taxpayers) decide to <br/>grant asylum, or grant waivers, etc. then they must pay for it, period.<br/><br/>4. Shortening processing times a couple months is no justification for<br/>increasing fees. Give me the slightly processing time and much lower fees<br/>please. Besides increasing efficiencies and automation on your end should<br/>result in reduced costs (capital equipment costs should be prorated out<br/>into the future).<br/><br/>5. Also, your waiver plan eligibility requirements require increased<br/>work on the petitioner end, and is in some ways is at odds with <br/>sponsorship financial requirements.<br/><br/>** 6. Most importantly, these steep fee increases will have the clear effect<br/>of discouraging rather than encouraging legal immigration.  This fee increase<br/>punishes those who want to follow the legal immigrant path. Wake up people!!<br/>and convey the implications of all this to the politions.<br/><br/>Flordeliza, U.S. Citizen<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802165c3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-20T13:43:23Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-20T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-20T01:16:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Flordeliza Rigby", "trackingNbr": "802165c3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1314/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1314/attachments"}}}}}
