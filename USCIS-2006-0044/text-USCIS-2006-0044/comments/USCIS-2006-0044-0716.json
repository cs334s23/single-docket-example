I had to <br/>contact my state senator&#39;s office twice to get my wife&#39;s EAD and Advance Parole <br/>appication approved on time.

I have been paying <br/>taxes regulary for the past 8 years and USCIS is taking immigrants like me for a <br/>ride for its poor service.<br/><br/>Any fees increases imposes an additional financial burden on us and once again I <br/>strongly oppose any increases.
