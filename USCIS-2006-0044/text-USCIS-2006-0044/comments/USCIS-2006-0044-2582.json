It<br/>puts a larger burden on Americans who are trying to create new families through<br/>adoption, and on Americans who are trying to reunite with other family members.<br/>It will not keep <br/>anyone out but only<br/>make it harder for people to follow the legal path.  Going through the<br/>international adoption<br/>process myself, it is already a long and expensive ordeal.  This will make it<br/>more so. <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de68", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T21:11:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Stephanie Mott", "trackingNbr": "8021de68", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2582/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2582/attachments"}}}}}
