In this<br/>sense, the fee increase is the equivalent of an illegal poll tax.<br/><br/>3) Insofar as legal immigrants pay taxes but cannot vote, they are essentially<br/>victims of taxation without representation.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9a86", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:31:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T02:22:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Ruth Henderson", "trackingNbr": "801f9a86", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0089/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0089/attachments"}}}}}
