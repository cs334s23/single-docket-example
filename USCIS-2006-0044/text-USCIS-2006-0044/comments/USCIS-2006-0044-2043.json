I feel that this document, which has <br/>proposed fee increases for Adoption-Related Petitions, is doing a disservice to the <br/>American people and mankind in general.  Adoption is a wonderful thing, it unites <br/>a needy child with a family that is ready to love and raise that child as if he/she <br/>were their own. The adoption process is already expensive, in addition to lengthy.  <br/>Hiking up the costs will certainly not promote more adoptions, rather it may <br/>decrease the number due to financial constraints. To think that the number of <br/>children that get adopted may be reduced, by however many, due to the increase <br/>in costs implemented by the U.S. government is an awful thought. Being a U.S. <br/>citizen, I more and more find myself embarrassed by my government. The passing <br/>of this document would certainly add to my frustrations.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b75b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:27:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T22:05:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael D.
