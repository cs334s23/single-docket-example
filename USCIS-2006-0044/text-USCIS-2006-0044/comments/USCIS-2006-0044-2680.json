Currently, my husband and I had to pay the<br/>following fees:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>Adoptions are taking longer, and many families will have to renew their<br/>fingerprints and application through the U.S. government while we wait for our<br/>adoptions to be finalized.  Due to the longer adoption process and you proposed<br/>fee increase, we will have to pay additional:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>I ask that you not increase the fees.
