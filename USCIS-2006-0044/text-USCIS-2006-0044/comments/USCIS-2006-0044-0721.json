The adoption <br/>process already requires a substantial amount of funding from the parents. There <br/>is a misconception that parents or single people who adopt are wealthy. This is <br/>not true. Many of us look into financial loans. To increase the fees would just <br/>cause additional hardships and make it more difficult for parents to adopt <br/>abandoned children who need a family and home, in order to make a better <br/>society. Please do not increase the fees.<br/><br/>Thank you greatly.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802094b7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:46:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-18T15:11:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "802094b7", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0721/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0721/attachments"}}}}}
