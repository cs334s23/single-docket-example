Many have endured great hardships in immigrating <br/>to the United States of America and due to language/cultural barriers must take <br/>low paying positions when they arrive.  I would rather see graduated fees based on <br/>income.  Certainly a professional with a good income could afford to pay the <br/>proposed fees, however, a minimum wage earner would often find it very difficult to <br/>do so.  Refugee centers estimate that it could take up to a full month&#39;s wages to <br/>meet the proposed fee requirements.  That seems a very steep price to pay for <br/>citizenship in our country-a country whose government was formed by immigrants <br/>from many countries- and who did not pay to enter.  Please reconsider the <br/>proposed fee requirements and try to construct a more fair and equitable fee <br/>schedule that will keep citizenship within the reach of the &quot;little man and woman&quot;.  <br/>Thank your for taking time to listen to my views.<br/>Sincerely,  Lewellyne Blanchard  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab21", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:58:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T23:00:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lewellyne C.
