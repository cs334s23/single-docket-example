We feel our son has the right to have a sibiling.  If the fees are increased it <br/>would just add to the expenses we already have.  These children need good <br/>homes and some people are really going out of their way financially to give them <br/>that.  Increasing the fees may put to much of a financial burden on adoptive <br/>parents which would lead to the children not getting the chance to live in a <br/>wonderful loving home.  Please PLEASE do not increase these fees.  Give us <br/>adoptive parents a break on this one and support our choice to parent.  We love <br/>our chidren and love the children of the world.  Please give us the opportunity to <br/>better their lives and ours!<br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Shelley R.
