The communities have already <br/>experienced the increase of pretty much everything except wages. I do <br/>understand that some costs needs to be covered by application fee but increasing <br/>it by almost 100% - it is a robbery. I would suggest increase the fee by $ 20.00 <br/>each year not 100%. Maybe there is mismanagement in some departments, and <br/>we should also look into it before increasing the fee.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802143fb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-16T18:17:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-16T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-15T18:05:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "802143fb", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1280/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1280/attachments"}}}}}
