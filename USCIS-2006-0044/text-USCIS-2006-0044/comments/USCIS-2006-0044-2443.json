The fee increase suggested would be <br/>doubled for these families. Submitting the I600-A to adopt a child internationally is <br/>no longer a one time occurrence. These families are also having to be re-<br/>fingerprinted between 2 to 3 times during their wait for a child (which is expected <br/>to lengthen). This means that in order for these families to adopt a child from <br/>China the I600-A process will cost them between $1660 to $1820 under the <br/>proposed increase.
