Plus it is only issued for a <br/>year, so the applicant HAS TO reapply them every year, which is added work and <br/>waste of money for both parties. For I-485 application, most of the lucky people <br/>are getting their background check cleared in a timely manner. For those who are <br/>unlucky, it takes years. And I don&#39;t believe increasing the fee will bring them <br/>anything earlier. I am one of the unlucky ones, with background check pending for <br/>2 years and still waiting. I am strongly oppose this kind of rate increase!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f992d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T21:31:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T21:13:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801f992d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0044/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0044/attachments"}}}}}
