I&#39;m <br/>opposed to fees increasing for all the petitions at USCIS, but the adoption fees <br/>affect me personally because I am the pre-adoptive mother of an abandoned 20-<br/>month old child in Guatemala who I am waiting and waiting for.<br/><br/>Fees for adoption should be held because they are high enough and many <br/>adoptive parents also have to file and pay TWICE because the approval<br/>is only good for 18 months and international adoptions are taking longer and <br/>longer.<br/><br/>I am paying a huge sum of money in total to adopt my child in Guatemala.  Here <br/>is what it costs just to file with USCIS to adopt:<br/><br/>What it used to be when adoptions took place within 18 months:<br/>I600A: $545<br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975, or over 140%!  And that&#39;s not even taking into <br/>consideration the fact that applying for our child&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 <br/>visas) goes from $215 to $460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase. <br/>Sometimes, adoptive parents don&#39;t even get the certificates for a year after filing!<br/><br/>It is outrageous and unfair to raise USCIS fees for well-meaning people who just <br/>want to do something good for themselves and for children who need that.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Madeleine Nash<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ddc2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:07:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T19:16:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Pre Adoptive Parent, Madeline Nash", "trackingNbr": "8021ddc2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2565/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2565/attachments"}}}}}
