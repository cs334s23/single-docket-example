As you know it is a <br/>very costly process.  Although increasing fees a few hundred dollars seems <br/>minimal,  yet when you consider the total cost, it really adds up.  The increase in <br/>fees I believe will deter others from pursuing international adoption which would be <br/>extremely unfortunate.  The process of adoption again is already costly but also <br/>emotionally trying.  Please consider not raising your fees.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b4cf", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:11:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T16:56:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rennie T.
