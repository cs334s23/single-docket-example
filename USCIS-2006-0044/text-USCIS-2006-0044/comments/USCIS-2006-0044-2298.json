My husband and I are currently in the <br/>process of adoption a child from China.<br/><br/>Here is what it costs to file with USCIS for a couple to adopt prior to the recent <br/>slow down:<br/><br/>When Chinese adoption took less then 18 months - those days are long gone:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 or over 140%! The USCIS will<br/>make 140% from adopting parents, with no real increase in services.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s not even taking into consideration the fact that applying for our<br/>children&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) goes from $215 to<br/>$460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase. Sometimes, we don&#39;t even<br/>get the certificates for a year after filing!<br/><br/>It is all very difficult to understand - when you cannot have a family by natural <br/>means and your only hope for raising a child is through adoption it does not feel <br/>particularly good when you feel like your own government wants to add to the <br/>burden.  Please consider all of use little people and the struggles we face when <br/>you make these substantial increases.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/>Heather<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cdaa", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:50:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T16:16:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Heather Kane", "trackingNbr": "8021cdaa", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2298/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2298/attachments"}}}}}
