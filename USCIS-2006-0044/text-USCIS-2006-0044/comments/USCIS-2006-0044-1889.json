We are proudly <br/>adopting a child from Guatemala.  The costs of adoption are tremendous!  I am <br/>asking that fees related to USCIS remain unchanged.  As I said, costs are <br/>outrageous and these fee increases only add to the overwhelming burden already.  <br/>Like many others, all we want to do is add to our family through adoption while <br/>helping a child in desperate need of a loving family.  Without families like us, <br/>these children would live in dire poverty, malnourishment, possible abuse....  <br/>Please, do not increase the current fees.  It is bad enough that our unchanged <br/>fingerprints are only &quot;valid&quot; for 18 months, now our United States Govt is trying to <br/>penalize potential adoptive families with outrageous fees.  These fees may <br/>eliminate some families from proceeding with an adoption.  The end result will be <br/>more poverty, sickness and possible death for all of these innocent children.  <br/>Please give this serious consideration, children are depending on you.<br/><br/>Thank You  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a975", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:58:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T19:14:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa Severa", "trackingNbr": "8021a975", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1889/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1889/attachments"}}}}}
