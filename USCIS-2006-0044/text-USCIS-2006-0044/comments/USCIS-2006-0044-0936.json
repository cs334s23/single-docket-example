I do not understand how this country can on <br/>one hand depend on the labor from immigrants abroad and on the other hand treat <br/>them like criminals.  I thought the idea of the &#39;Blue Card&#39; was great.  Anyone <br/>working in the U.S. for a year (6 months) can obtain a &#39;blue card&#39; and go through <br/>the necessary channels to become a citizen or receive a &#39;green card&#39;.  Although I <br/>would think that it would benefit our country if we eliminated the &#39;green card&#39; and <br/>ask that all &#39;peoples&#39; living in this country pay taxes.  One can have duel <br/>citizenship and that might be one possible solution to our large population <br/>especially from Mexico. <br/>We cannot continue to exploit these people.  We must be fair.  Asking high fees <br/>to become a citizen is not the solution.  Shipping people to prision rings of Nazi <br/>Germany.  These Texas prisions are horrid.  Sometimes I wonder if this country <br/>has lost some essential quality that makes us fair and humane to others, or has <br/>our greed become so insidious that we can&#39;t see others needs<br/>Let&#39;s please attempt to find fair solutions that benefit business, workers and <br/>familites of our workers from abroad.<br/>Scrap this idea of higher fees, it is neither just or humane to burdan people who&#39;s <br/>only crime is to want a better life. and that is not really a crime.  We all want <br/>better for our children.<br/>Respectfully;<br/>Pat Porter.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bbd0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T16:57:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T16:38:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Pat Porter", "trackingNbr": "8020bbd0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0936/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0936/attachments"}}}}}
