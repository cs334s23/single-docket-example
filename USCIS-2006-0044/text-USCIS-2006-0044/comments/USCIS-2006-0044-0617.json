The increases are very substantial to what is already a very high fee. <br/><br/>I am also hopeful that consideration of H.R. Bill # 628 to extend the expiry of<br/>the I-171H to 24 months will be heard by the House of Representatives soon. This<br/>is a practical solution to the problem that most of us adopting (especially from<br/>China) face - i.e. having to resubmit for the I-171H, thus essentially doubling<br/>the fee as well as doubling the workload for USCIS officials. Increases to the<br/>fee along with no change in the expiration period, will mean doubling an even<br/>higher fee.<br/><br/>I trust that USCIS officials will have the good sense to PROMOTE rather than<br/>DISSUADE adoption of foreign born orphans by considering a 5 to 8% increase in<br/>the fee instead, coupled with an increase in time of expiration of the<br/>I-600A/I-171H to 24 months.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>Stephen Moffitt<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802081aa", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T20:19:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T05:25:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Stephen R Moffitt", "trackingNbr": "802081aa", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0617/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0617/attachments"}}}}}
