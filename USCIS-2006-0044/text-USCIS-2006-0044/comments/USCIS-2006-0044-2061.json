This greatly <br/>impacts many families in the process of internaltion adoption.  The cost of <br/>adoption is already a burden on some families desperate to have children.  It may <br/>not seem like much but the increases being proposed could be the difference <br/>between the ability to adopt a child or not.  This impact American families with <br/>dreams to have children and their pursuit of happiness.  Is an increase really <br/>necessary?  I think not.  People making this decision may think it is a small <br/>increase but it has huge impacts on American families.  I ask that this decision is <br/>reconsidered and you take into account the impact it will have.  It doesn&#39;t have to <br/>be all about the all mighty dollar.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b808", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T23:03:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T00:54:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021b808", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2061/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2061/attachments"}}}}}
