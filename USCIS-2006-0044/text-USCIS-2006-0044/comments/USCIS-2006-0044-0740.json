Please extend the length of time that the 1-171H is valid <br/>so that all the waiting families that are already waiting through increased wait <br/>times do not have to be further penalized to re-file another I-600A and in our case <br/>have to drive 4 hours to get re-fingerprinted.  Those of us who chose to adopt a <br/>child have been through enough already.  <br/><br/>However, if we do have to re-file because the countries we are adopting from have <br/>longer wait times and thus our forms expire, then please do not increase the <br/>amount of money we have to pay for something we have already done and expires <br/>out of our control and so only becomes another expense to the waiting family.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802095d9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:48:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-19T21:39:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Catherine Gardner", "trackingNbr": "802095d9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0740/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0740/attachments"}}}}}
