As a waiting adoptive parent, we have already applied once to receive our I-<br/>171H.  Because we are going through China, due to the recent slow down there <br/>we will have to RE-submit our I-600A.  Chinese adoptees represent the majority of <br/>orphans adopted by American Parents, almost all of whom will now have to file at <br/>least two I-600A&#39;s before receiving their child.  Already cost prohibitive, your price <br/>increase of $145 including biometrics will cause many prospective parents to be <br/>unable to continue.  I would think that getting $545 plus $140 for new fingerprints <br/>from almost 6000 re-applicants would more than cover any needed funding <br/>increases.  Please re-consider this cost increase as it will hurt many waiting <br/>families.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802074ed", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:23:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T11:26:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cynthia W.
