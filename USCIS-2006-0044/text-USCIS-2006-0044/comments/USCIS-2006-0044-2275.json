It is so very hard for most <br/>families adopting to raise all of the needed money without going into debt.  There <br/>is such a great need for adoption in this world.  Please don&#39;t make it MORE <br/>difficult for those of us who WANT these orphans, but financially can&#39;t put together <br/>the gigantic sums of money needed to bring them home.  Thank you.
