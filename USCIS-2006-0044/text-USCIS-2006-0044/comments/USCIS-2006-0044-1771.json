If <br/>government offices would share information with eachother there would be no need <br/>to increase fees.  You would be able to decrease fees, because then we wouldn&#39;t <br/>have the need for multiple back ground checks and multiple fingerprints through all <br/>the different agencies.  This would allow people to be able to get application&#39;s <br/>processed quicker because the same information would be available through all <br/>governemental agencies since the information would be shared.  Our costs of <br/>adopting would be lowered because we wouldn&#39;t be required to get our fingerprints <br/>done 3 times, etc., etc.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a0fb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:04:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T01:05:05Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "8021a0fb", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1771/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1771/attachments"}}}}}
