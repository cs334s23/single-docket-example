We recently <br/>adopted from China and due to the unexpected slowdown we had to redo all of our <br/>paperwork and pay double on all the fees.  I believe that this is an undue burden <br/>on families who already have numerous fees and expenses related to adoption.  <br/>Most families are working hard to provide loving homes for abandoned children and <br/>would appreciate help and not another roadblock in this journey.  Please consider <br/>keeping the fees the same at least for the time being until things stabilize in the <br/>adoption community and a decision is made that will keep the paperwork current <br/>for longer.  I do not think people would mind a slight increase if they only have to <br/>pay once, not twice or three times as seems to be happening right now.<br/><br/>Thanks for listening,<br/><br/>Glenda Nanna<br/>mom to Kylee from China<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020917d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:43:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T21:32:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Glenda H.
