The fees already collected are more than significant and <br/>make the adoption of children internaionally VERY financially burdensom.  The <br/>costs are currently prohibiting some couples from persuing this alternative as a <br/>means to grow there families and leave it as an option for only the upper-class &amp; <br/>exorbitantly wealthy.  It is the middle class who can not afford exhaustive infertility <br/>treatment who often persue this means and the others (like us) are trying to follow <br/>our hearts and philanthropic calling to provide children in impoverished countries <br/>with a chance to succeed in life.  And lastly, I can&#39;t understand how it could <br/>possibly cost more than the fees aready collected to fingerprint individuals and <br/>submit an application.  Please re-consider this increase and help keep <br/>international adoption a feasible alternative to growing beautifully diverse American <br/>families.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021abbe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:08:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T00:48:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Amanda C.
