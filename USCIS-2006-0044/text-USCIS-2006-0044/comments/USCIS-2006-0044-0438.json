It will most definitely increase the general frustration with<br/>government entities in their consistent &quot;red tape&quot; surrounding adoption<br/>processes. The government should rather be endorsing such humanity as taking<br/>care of orphans. This will no doubt be a source of disdain among the adoption<br/>community and so viewed upon as discouragement and lack of support from our<br/>countries leaders to support those in need.(I am speaking of the orphans, mostly<br/>in institutes, and impoverished countries.)<br/><br/>Specifically relating to renewal of the I600A form and refingerprinting, it is a<br/>quite unnecessary fee. While it is realized that the initial authorization could<br/>indeed take some time for the USCIS to review, it should be a much easier and<br/>quicker process to renew such a document. For instance, a person&#39;s fingerprints<br/>do not change, and therefore they should not need to be refingerprinted, indeed<br/>the original fingerprints should just be recleared through the FBI. Likewise,<br/>the homestudy and copies of BC and Marriage Cert. should be reviewed for any<br/>changes only. If no changes, it should be sufficient to only state this. I could<br/>recognize a greater workload if changes occurred. <br/><br/>The most frustration that arises out of this, is that all International<br/>adoptions are taking longer to complete, resulting from the Hague Agreement, a<br/>government instituted change. Also, the current time of validity for the I171H<br/>is insufficient for its purpose due to this increased time for adoption<br/>completion. Therefore this increased financial hardship upon adoptive families<br/>is directly caused by our US government themselves.<br/><br/>If you have taken the time to read and consider my comments, I thank you deeply.<br/>My concern is much deeper than this, and I hope that you will not increase such<br/>fees, but that the expiration/validity will increase, and the process of I171H<br/>approval with become more cost effective.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206e95", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:12:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T04:02:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kristy R.
