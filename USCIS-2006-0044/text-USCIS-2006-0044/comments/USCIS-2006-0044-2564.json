We are planning to go back to <br/>China next year to adopt our second child. Because of changes in China?s <br/>adoption process, we will most likely have to pay the fees for the I-600/600A <br/>(Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative) and for fingerprinting twice. <br/>It?s bad enough that we will be forced to pay these fees again, but when I found <br/>out that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services plans to raise these fees <br/>up to 66%, I was horrified. Adoption is expensive enough! We are trying to give a <br/>child a better life here in America. I hope you will not raise your fees and consider <br/>increasing the time that the I-600 and fingerprints are valid. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Amy Harris<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ddc1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:07:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T19:16:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Amy Harris", "trackingNbr": "8021ddc1", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2564/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2564/attachments"}}}}}
