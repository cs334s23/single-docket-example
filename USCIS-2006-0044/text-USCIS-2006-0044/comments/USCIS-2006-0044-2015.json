My husband and I are in <br/>the midst of an international adoption and the costs are already incredibly high.  <br/>With the timeframe that most of these documents remain valid, we are also in the <br/>position of having to pay the fees TWICE because the documents are likely to <br/>expire before we can travel.  The US Government should not be putting additional <br/>hurdles in the paths of American families who are happy to open their homes to <br/>children around the world who need families.  We are prepared to meet the <br/>financial costs, provide an education, provide healthcare coverage and, most <br/>importantly, provide the love and care that a child will need. Please support us in <br/>this process rather than undercutting our efforts.
