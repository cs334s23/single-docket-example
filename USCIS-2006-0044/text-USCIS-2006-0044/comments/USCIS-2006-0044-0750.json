The current wait times for several countries, China specifically, have <br/>increased so dramatically that it is possible that many adoptive families will have <br/>to re-file the same application two to three times and be re-fingerprinted the same <br/>number of times before finalizing adoption. The financial burden involved in this is <br/>too much. The 18 month expiration on the I-171H needs to be extended or waived <br/>in order to prevent families from having to pay the US government more money to <br/>process the same paperwork twice. If the reason for fee increases is to streamline <br/>the process then I suggest you streamline the process first to take the burden of <br/>work off the government by having to re-process the same paperwork twice!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020986c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:49:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-20T15:01:22Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Emily J.
