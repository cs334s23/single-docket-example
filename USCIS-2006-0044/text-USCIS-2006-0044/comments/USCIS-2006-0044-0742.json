To raise fees, at this time, puts<br/>an extra burden on us, beyond what is customary.<br/><br/>If fees need to be raised, then I would propose that the length of time the I-171 is <br/>good for be extended to 24 months, and the fingerprinting be extended to 24 <br/>months.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Tina Proper<br/>Adoptive Parent<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802095ee", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:48:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-19T22:58:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tina R.
