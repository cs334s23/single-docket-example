As you can imagine, international <br/>adoptions are expensive and with the increased wait times from when a family <br/>submits their dossier until they receive a referral, the family typically has to renew <br/>various documents, therefore paying filing fees twice.  I am asking that you please <br/>DO NOT increase your filing fees as this will put an even greater financial strain on <br/>families who wish to adopt.  It is frustrating to have to renew fingerprints, the I-<br/>600A, etc. and having to pay the additional costs associated with doing so.  I am <br/>not sure what prompted the USCIS to consider increasing their fees, but I truly <br/>hope they do not forward their proposed increase to the Office of Management and <br/>Budget for approval.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aa5d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T02:49:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T20:33:50Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Denise", "trackingNbr": "8021aa5d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1906/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1906/attachments"}}}}}
