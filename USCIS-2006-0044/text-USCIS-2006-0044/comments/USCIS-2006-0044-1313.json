I understand there is pressure to increase fees, but your proposed amounts<br/>are way too much too fast.<br/><br/>2.  Increased scrutiny and checking time obviously costs more. But this is a<br/>U.S. security decision that immigration petitioners (and indirectly U.S. citizen<br/>sponsors) should not be burdened to mostly bear.  I believe it is fair for<br/>taxpayers to share much of this burden, as the fee increases are way too steep.<br/><br/>3.  Also, additional department costs, such as refugee surcharges that have<br/>nothing to do with immigrant fees for specific purposes.  Fees should not be<br/>increased for these reasons.<br/><br/>4.  Shortening processing times a couple months is no justification for<br/>increasing fees.  Give me the slightly processing time and much lower fees<br/>please.  Besides increasing efficiencies on your end should result in reduced costs.<br/><br/>5.  Most important, your waiver plan eligibility requirements require increased<br/>work on the petitioner end, is in some ways is at odds with sponsorship<br/>financial requirements, and will have the clear effect of discouraging rather<br/>than encouraging legal immigration.<br/><br/>** This fee increase clearly punishes those who want to follow the legal<br/>immigrant path.
