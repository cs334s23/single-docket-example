This fee hike will force immigrants who have various family members<br/>that simultaneously qualify for benefits not to be able to file together because<br/>these fees are so exorbitant.  If CIS is fee based, how does it plan on<br/>surviving if filings significantly drop off because immigrants can&#39;t afford the<br/>fees?  <br/>I heard the argument that $295 for citizenship is very low and does not reflect<br/>the value of this honor. To those who said that, I would ask them to take into<br/>account the full price tag for the entire process. To become a citizen one must<br/>first have a visa, then a green card, then after security and medical checks one<br/>can apply for citizenship. This process is currently costing way over $10,000 if<br/>you take into account all paperwork fees and an affordable attorney who can<br/>maneuver through the complex system. If doubling and tripling fees will ensure a<br/>smooth process where applicants do not have to hire an expert, have to pay for<br/>all other extras and the service improves, then I would consider it a step<br/>forward. However, USCIS has raised fees in the past only to keep backlogs<br/>growing and service diminishing. No valid argument has been raised for this<br/>outrageous fee hike.<br/>A small fee hike may understandable but doubling or tripling the fees is<br/>unreasonable and severe and I urge you to reconsider. Thank you. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef45", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:01Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:07:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Henry Waxman", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Andrea Leon-Grossmann", "trackingNbr": "8021ef45", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2814/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2814/attachments"}}}}}
