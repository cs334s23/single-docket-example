The financial strain that is put <br/>upon most adoptive parents is enough. Some families will have to pay the fees <br/>more than once due to the fact that their immigration forms will expire before they <br/>are able to get their children home. To charge more and to not change the length <br/>for which forms expire is not helping.  It is only another hardship that we adoptive <br/>parents face.
