The wait period for China is <br/>currently 15-18 months.  This is almost a guarantee that I will have to refile my <br/>application and fingerprints and thus pay twice what I should have to anyway.<br/><br/>The fact that fingerprints expire after 15 months when the application is valid for 18 <br/>months is also redicilous.<br/><br/>I work as a police officer for a municipal agency.  The fact that fingerprints expire <br/>at all is also a strange to me.  If the fingerprints were taken and are made to <br/>expire at the time of the application for adoption, the system could rerun them if <br/>needed if there is a re-application.  Why reprint?<br/><br/>Please don&#39;t increase the fees.  Also, please lengethen the I-171H to 24 months <br/>as this would eleviate much stress and financial hardship for many of us.<br/><br/>Thanks, Rex Steele<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480209548", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:47:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-19T14:41:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rexford J.
