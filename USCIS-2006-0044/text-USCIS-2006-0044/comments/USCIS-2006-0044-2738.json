The changes in fees<br/>proposed in USCIS-2006-0044 will only serve to make international adoption less<br/>of an option for people of moderate means, and will place an undue burden on US<br/>citizens living overseas.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e86a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T09:06:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Daphne Katranides", "trackingNbr": "8021e86a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2738/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2738/attachments"}}}}}
