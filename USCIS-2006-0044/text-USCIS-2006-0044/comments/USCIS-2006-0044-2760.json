I went through this process just two years ago<br/>and the fees had just been increased then.  I am sure there are other ways to<br/>get money into the budget without increasing this expense. Adoption costs<br/>average $25k.  That is completely out of pocket and it is not easy finding that<br/>kind of money for one adoption and sometimes two or more.  We should reward<br/>people for adopting not penialize them with hefty fees.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ecd3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T14:26:01Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T15:06:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Christopher Shays", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tracy Maus", "trackingNbr": "8021ecd3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2760/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2760/attachments"}}}}}
