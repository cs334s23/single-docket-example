I understand the need to charge reasonable fees to cover your costs.<br/> However, with the current timelines, those of us who adopt from China often<br/>have to file for these forms twice and pay the fee twice!  I would encourage you<br/>to increase the time allowed before these documents must be refiled, but at<br/>least reduce or remove the fee for the renewed documents.  This is a huge<br/>financial burden on those of us who adopt children. <br/><br/>I am OK with a reasonable increase in fees to cover costs, but please don&#39;t make<br/>us pay it twice, plus increase it so much.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480209407", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:45:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-17T03:57:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jeannene L.
