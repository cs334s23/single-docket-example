As you undoubtedly <br/>know, the international adoption process is very involved and expensive. The <br/>proposed fee increases will place undue pressure on adoptive families who are <br/>already experiencing the financial burdens associated with international adoption.  <br/><br/>While I understand that increasing fees are &quot;normal and customary&quot; for a variety of <br/>services in life, I expect that with increased fees we will receive increased levels of <br/>service.  The US government needs to staff the USCIS offices at level that will <br/>enable the personnel to expedite orphan petitions. Although my USCIS office <br/>(Tampa, FL) processed our I-600A and issued a subsequent I-171 rather quickly <br/>(and efficiently), there is a wide array of time frames for this service throughout the <br/>country. Depending on one&#39;s residency, this can vary by as much as 6 <br/>months...during which our children are growing older waiting for their final <br/>adoptions.  Also, obtaining the Certificiate of Citizenship can now sometimes take <br/>1 year after the child enters the US as our adopted child.  <br/><br/>In closing, my position is that it&#39;s acceptable to me to shoulder a fee increase as <br/>long as I know that the US will use the increased fees to bolster the <br/>staff/resources necessary to process our applications more quickly and efficiently. <br/>The current inefficiencies experienced by some families around the country are <br/>totally unacceptable.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Lisa Buonarosa<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dc7c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:20:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T15:40:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa Buonarosa", "trackingNbr": "8021dc7c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2534/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2534/attachments"}}}}}
