I realize other fees are out of the <br/>control of your agency, but nonetheless, I ask you to take the big picture into <br/>consideration.<br/> <br/>The financial burden of adoption, international adoption in particular, is already <br/>prohibitive for many.<br/>Please reject fee increases proposed by docket number USCIS-2006-0044. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Joanne Hughes<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021beb9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T02:32:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T14:39:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by J Hughes", "trackingNbr": "8021beb9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2205/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2205/attachments"}}}}}
