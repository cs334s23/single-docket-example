While I understand that an increase may be necessary <br/>because of inflation and increased security costs, I believe that the proposed <br/>increase is exceptionally high and would place an undue burden on those pursuing <br/>legal immigration and international adoption.  I hope that the magnitude of these <br/>increases will be reconsidered.  Immigration and adoption should be available to <br/>all, not only the wealthy. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ce86", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:50:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T18:02:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021ce86", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2401/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2401/attachments"}}}}}
