No  other gov agency, serving citizens can do this <br/>as there will be electoral conseequence.  Can you imagine DMV changing vehicle <br/>registeration fee from $200 to $400... and it goes unnoticed?<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802135d3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-14T14:00:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-14T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-13T17:22:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Pradeep", "trackingNbr": "802135d3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1269/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1269/attachments"}}}}}
