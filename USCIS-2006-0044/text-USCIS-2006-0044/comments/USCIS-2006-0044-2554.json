Because of<br/>the long wait times for international adoptions from China, and the fact that<br/>USCIS does not have a process for renewing I-600A vs. refiling as though making<br/>an initial application, our fees for that form alone will more than double since<br/>we will have to file twice before our adoption will be completed.  We ask that<br/>you please reconsider raising adoption-related fees.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Linnea S.
