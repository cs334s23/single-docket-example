Why is that?  Already, fingerprinting through the USCIS costs <br/>twice what it does at the local police station, for the exact same clearances.  And <br/>why make the application cost more?  Are you aware of the costs associated with <br/>international adoption?  I looked into adopting through social services, but the <br/>drama is at least as much as an international adoption, with no guarantees that a <br/>child places with you will be a permanent arrangement.  International adoption is <br/>more of a &quot;sure thing&quot; than adopting here in the United States, but it is also very <br/>expensive.  Why make families take an additional hit in the bank account, or <br/>delay children gaining a permanent family while parents scramble for more <br/>money?  The programs in China take quite some time, and most families have to <br/>reapply for a second I600A while waiting for a referral.  If you are going to raise the <br/>fees, can&#39;t you at least make a lower cost option for renewing and expiring <br/>clearance?  Thank you for listening.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802080b7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T18:25:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T04:00:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Karen B.", "trackingNbr": "802080b7", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0611/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0611/attachments"}}}}}
