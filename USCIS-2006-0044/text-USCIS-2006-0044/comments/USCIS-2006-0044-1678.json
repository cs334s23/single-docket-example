We had to go into debt, like so many other adopting <br/>families, and each time any fee associated with adoption is increased, another <br/>family can no longer afford to adopt.<br/><br/>Being a civilized country, I would think we would try to promote adoptions of <br/>orphans, not add additional financial burdens to the already overwhelming costs <br/>many families experience in the process.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time, <br/>L.A.
