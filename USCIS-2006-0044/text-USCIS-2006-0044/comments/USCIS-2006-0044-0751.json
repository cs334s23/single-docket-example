This is a <br/>status used by hospitals to employ health care professionals that are in short <br/>supply.  Most hospitals in the US are Non profit entities and this would create a <br/>hardship for them adding to the increase in our health care costs.  The I-129 is <br/>also used predominantly by large US corporations that can well afford the <br/>additional costs.  <br/><br/>I would like to suggest a separate and new category for health care professionals <br/>only (similar to the E-3 status alloted to Australians only) and at a modest fee <br/>increase to $200.00 per application.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020987f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:14:25Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-20T15:04:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sheila Murray", "trackingNbr": "8020987f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0751/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0751/attachments"}}}}}
