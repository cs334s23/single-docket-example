During <br/>our experience with your required offices and forms, we found it to be the slowest, <br/>most innefficient process imaginable.  The funding to improve this process should <br/>be found in better processes and efficiencies, not in more funding for an overly <br/>bureaucratic system.  The amount of duplicated process that could have been <br/>easily avoided (offices that don&#39;t have a phone???) and costly mistakes by <br/>underqualified/unempowered employees was mind boggling. (With only parents <br/>and children left to endure the consequences) Any for-profit company that was run <br/>like the governmental offices/processes that adoptive parents are forced to use, <br/>would be bankrupt and investigated!<br/><br/>To increase the fees without better serving parents and children is unimaginable.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ce54", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:51:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T17:39:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lili McCutchan", "trackingNbr": "8021ce54", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2312/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2312/attachments"}}}}}
