However, the additional expenses for the processing of the required US <br/>government forms alone can make it impossible for some families to bear this <br/>burden.<br/><br/>It is understood that costs to process these documents will increase over time, <br/>but in 1985 the I-600/-600A cost $50.00, the N-565 was $15.00 and the N-600 was <br/>$35.00.  The extreme documentation fee increases for these forms are difficult to <br/>understand.<br/><br/>This current round of proposed increases is severely out of line with the cost of <br/>inflation since the last increase of 2005.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021db93", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:18:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T12:53:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lauren Spera", "trackingNbr": "8021db93", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2509/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2509/attachments"}}}}}
