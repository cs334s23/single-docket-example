Adoption costs are escalating and the U.S. doesn&#39;t help in keeping those <br/>costs at a minimun.  We are already having to repeat Biometrics and refile/renew <br/>the I600A form prior to finalization of referrals!!!  So we are paying twice for <br/>something that should only be done once!  If the fees do go up, I would <br/>recommend that if the forms have to be refiled before expiration then have a <br/>nominal fee (not the original fee) to renew.  Nominal fee meaning less than 1/2 of <br/>the original fee.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021deaa", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T22:04:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021deaa", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2587/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2587/attachments"}}}}}
