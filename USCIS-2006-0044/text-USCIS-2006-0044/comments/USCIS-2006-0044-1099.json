As someone who works with new Americans, I have the <br/>opportunity to see immigrant families start their lives over on a daily basis.  I see <br/>immigrant workers with entry level jobs struggle to meet the basic needs of their <br/>families.  At the same time, I see these same immigrants talk of their <br/>naturalization ceremony with the same enthusiasm as they do the birth of a child.  <br/>While it is understandable that USCIS must use fees to improve their services, it <br/>pains me that the fee increases - particularly for naturalization - may not permit <br/>immigrants to become American citizens, something that they desperately want - <br/>and which we as Americans do as well.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021059d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T18:42:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-08T22:24:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Louisa Saratora", "trackingNbr": "8021059d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1099/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1099/attachments"}}}}}
