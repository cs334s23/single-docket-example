Foreign adoptions already cost easily $20,000+.  Many of <br/>us have to renew our I-171 H after it expires because the countries we are adopting from do not <br/>process adoptions quickly.  Why an extension of this form costs anything is beyond me!  We <br/>already pay the current rate of $545 plus the fingerpinting fee of $70  twice!  That&#39;s $1230 for one <br/>form at the current prices.  Do not make it any financially harder for Americans to adopt.  There are <br/>enough hoops we have to jump through as is!
