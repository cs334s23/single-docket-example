The cost of International adoption is outrageous as it is without <br/>our government raising the related fees to unproportionate levels. <br/><br/>With this level of service and the current prolonged processing time, I do not feel <br/>that an increase in the fees is warrented. If it came with changes such as a two <br/>week turnaround time or some other benefit, that might be acceptable. However, <br/>as is the current situation I strongly object to the new fees.<br/><br/>The service I received from the US embassy here in Chile was totally irrational and <br/>they treated me in a very rude and obnoxious manner. The center for processing <br/>my adoption was the Lima Peru USCIS office. However since my permanent <br/>residence is in Chile, I needed the US embassy to receive my application and to <br/>do my fingerprints. Those are two very simple procedures. They refused to do <br/>them since they were not processing my adoption. I had to pay the fee to be <br/>fingerprinted which by the way they charged me the proposed $80.00 back in <br/>2005, it took me four months and the intervention of vice consuls in Lima and <br/>Gaunzhou before they would agree to do the fingerprints. They wanted me to travel <br/>to Peru to have them done. Once they agreed to do them, I was forced to wait <br/>almost three weeks before being fingerprinted. That is just completely <br/>unacceptable behavior. A raise in the fees will not make the service any better and <br/>I do not feel that we should have to pay more money to be insulted and treated <br/>badly.<br/><br/>Many families living in the continently US have had very similiar experiences. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Anna Denton<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e60", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:17:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anna Denton", "trackingNbr": "80219e60", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1694/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1694/attachments"}}}}}
