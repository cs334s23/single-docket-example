The costs are <br/>daunting, the paperwork excrutiating, add that to the lengthening times of referrals-a <br/>devastation only those waiting can possibly understand. <br/>The last thing we need-after already completing a homestudy, receiving approval , and <br/>refinancing our homes to pay for an adoption,is to have to redo everything and now to <br/>top it off, pay even more money. I do not think it is fair- to increase or even double <br/>charge families that have already been approved.<br/>I was told that this redoing of fingerprints is &quot;for the benefit of the orphan&quot;  and I <br/>strongly disagree. People can give birth with no approval whatsoever, they can be <br/>horrid parents, but we as a group have had every aspect of our lives checked out and <br/>have been approved!  Anyone undertaking this huge, life altering, decision to adopt an <br/>orphan, in my opinion, has proven themselves fit just by going through the process.<br/>Again, I think increasing fees on those who already have approval is unjust.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening,<br/>Marnie Gray<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802076ed", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:30:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T13:21:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Marnie Gray", "trackingNbr": "802076ed", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0449/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0449/attachments"}}}}}
