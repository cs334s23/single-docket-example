There is a perception, with the Angelina Jolie and Madonna <br/>incidents, international adoption is only for the wealthy.  <br/><br/>I have met many families who are so excited about the adoption proces as well as <br/>the prospect of adopting. These are working class families who have taken the <br/>time to stretch their financial and personal responsibilities to provide a home for <br/>these children.<br/><br/>To increase rates further would continue to deter families as the international <br/>adoption process requires not only time but significant monetary resources.  Is <br/>this really an areas where USCIS needs to make up a budgetary shortfall - an area <br/>where American families are helping needy children and adding to the melting pot <br/>that is our country?  Is it right to punish a group who have had to go through so <br/>much from a legal standpoint and then increase fees by 50%?<br/><br/>I urge you to reconsider this as increase as international adoption is a great thing <br/>with tremendous momentum - it would be terrible if it is thought of as only <br/>accessible to the rich.<br/><br/>Victor Woo<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a8cb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:54:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:51:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Victor W.
