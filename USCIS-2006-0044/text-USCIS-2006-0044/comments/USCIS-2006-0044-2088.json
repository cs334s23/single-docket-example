As you <br/>know, the government has tried to lessen the burden on families such as mine by <br/>providing a tax credit for adoption expenses on federal income taxes.  While that <br/>credit is certainly helpful, it is less than half what a typical international adoption <br/>costs.  To me, the government seems at cross-purposes if one branch takes <br/>action to defray particiular costs, while another takes action to increase those <br/>same costs.<br/><br/>What is it we are trying to encourage?  I find it ironic that as I write, Congress is <br/>considering raising the federal tax on tobacco.  Beyond the fact that we cold raise <br/>significant revenue with such an increase, there&#39;s a higher logic at work in that <br/>situation because no doubt the government would like to discourage people from <br/>using tobacco products.  By the same token, I was under the impression that the <br/>government would like to encourage people to adopt children in need, both <br/>domestically and abroad.  I think this is the logic of the aforementioned tax credit.  <br/>To now raise immigration fees that pertain to children adopted from abroad--and in <br/>some cases, the proposed increases are very substantial--would be to counteract <br/>what you are trying to encourage.  <br/><br/>I know decisions like this are not easy.  But I hope you would reconsider the <br/>current proposal so that families who are already struggling to do something the <br/>government is on record supporting, would not be further burdened by the very <br/>same government.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b18f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T00:44:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T11:29:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anthony F.
