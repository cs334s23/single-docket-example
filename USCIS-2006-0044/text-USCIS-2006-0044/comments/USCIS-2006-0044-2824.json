I <br/>am posting this here to state that I strongly disagree with this increase. The <br/>process of adoption, and government fees, have doubled since our last adoption <br/>in &#39;98. It is almost impossible to afford the process at all as it is, now it will be <br/>even less so with a 66 percent increase from you. We started our second <br/>adoption process in fall &#39;05 and will not finish until this summer. We planned out <br/>every penny to the dime, as we had to borrow the money( almost everyone has to) <br/>and now you are going to ask us to come up with more money than we planned. <br/>This increase is HUGE!!! Maybe a small one would be understandable, but not <br/>this. There are so many government programs that are out of hand, esp. welfare. <br/>We are good tax paying citizens that actually work for a living, and we end up <br/>paying for those who do not want to work! ( I know there are a few that actually <br/>need this service, that is okay, but most do NOT) All I am saying is do not stick a <br/>good program like adoption with more fees, try something else, PLEASE! <br/>Thank you for letting us voice our opinion, I hope you will listen.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef78", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:25:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021ef78", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2824/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2824/attachments"}}}}}
