It is very difficult <br/>because of the regulations concerning our required  level of income, even tho we <br/>are not on gov&#39;t assistance, and have not been for years.  We do not meet the <br/>income requirements, but have many assets.  We would ask you to consider this <br/>issue, as we have always managed quite well with what we have, feeding and <br/>clothing and housing our children more than adequately.  We desire to provide a <br/>loving home to orphans. Please consider lowering the standard of &quot;poverty level <br/>income&quot;.   <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Also, there are many expenses in adoption, and certain documents sometimes <br/>expire before the process is complete.  We have witnessed this through friends <br/>who are adopting.  They had to get a joint sponsor to meet income requirements, <br/>and were well into the process, when their home study, and other documents <br/>actually expired due to no fault of their own. Still, they will complete the process, <br/>though it created more expense and added hardship.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I am asking that you do not raise the fees of adoption any more, as it is <br/>already difficult and costly enough for many of us who have a sincere desire to <br/>help these children who are in desperate need of even a meal, let alone a home to <br/>thrive in. Allow us the ability to help and to be blessed by these beautiful children. <br/>Sincerely, Tina Puckett<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e661", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:39:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T00:45:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tina Puckett", "trackingNbr": "8021e661", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2702/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2702/attachments"}}}}}
