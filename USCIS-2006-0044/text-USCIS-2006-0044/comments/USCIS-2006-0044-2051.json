Adoption in general, but especially <br/>international adoption, is already an expensive, stressful, and unpredictable under-<br/>taking. I&#39;m sure other adoptive parents have told you of the months or years of <br/>waiting, the tens of thousands of dollars in expense, and the lifetimes of <br/>commitment to children -- many of whom have medical and emotional conditions <br/>related to their sub-standard care in overseas orphanages. These parents make <br/>great sacrifices to adopt internationally and should be honored, not punished with <br/>higher fees from USCIS. It is impractical and illogical for the US government to <br/>raise rates from one department and then offer a tax credit for adoption-related <br/>expenses on the other. Our adoption will cost us $10,000 beyond the credit, so <br/>there is still a need to maintain or reduce USCIS fees, not increase them.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b7be", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:37:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T23:52:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Angela J.
