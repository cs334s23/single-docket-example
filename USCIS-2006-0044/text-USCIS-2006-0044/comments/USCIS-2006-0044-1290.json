When the I600a<br/>expires, our re-submission is regarded as brand new and we have to provide all<br/>the same documents....again.  We have to pay all the same fees.....again.   <br/><br/>I understand you need to raise fees to cover the work that you do.  However,<br/>since we are re-submitting, is there any way we can get a break on our costs?  <br/> You&#39;ve already done all the work already - why &#39;reinvent the wheel&#39;, so to<br/>speak.   Keep some info in the system....see if it has changed....and if it<br/>hasn&#39;t - give us a new form at a reduced cost.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration. <br/><br/>Susan Binzel<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021464b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-16T18:29:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-16T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-16T04:58:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Susan Binzel", "trackingNbr": "8021464b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1290/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1290/attachments"}}}}}
