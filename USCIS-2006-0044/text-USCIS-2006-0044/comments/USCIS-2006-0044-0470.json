This cost has been increased significantly over the last several years, <br/>and we are now facing yet another substantial rate increase by this office. This <br/>cost is already a burden for adoptive parents. Many families are adopting from <br/>China and now have to go through this process twice due to the wait times, so <br/>that this increase in reality is two-fold of what is proposed. Families are already <br/>stretched to the limit financially by the process of adoption, and must now face <br/>the increase of fees by our own government, yet again.<br/><br/>It certainly appears that fees for other paperwork processing at USCIS have not <br/>risen the same amount as those from adoptive parents. To us it feels as if we are <br/>being penalized for adopting by having to fund other programs at USCIS with our <br/>fees.  Our taxes already support those services- we are paying for processing of <br/>our paperwork for adoption.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207a48", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T17:04:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T17:07:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Amy J.
