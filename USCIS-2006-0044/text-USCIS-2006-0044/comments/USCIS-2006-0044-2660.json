Due to the slow down we have to re-do I600A form and finger <br/>prints.  There should be an extension put on our documents not to have to resumit <br/>and surely if we have to re-submit their could be a decrease in cost instead of the <br/>proposed increase which is quite absurd.  This is truly a way of taking advantage <br/>of good citizens who are taking in little girls not wanted in another country who will <br/>have no quality of life if not adopted.  I am proud of being a citizen of the US and <br/>know the government has the best interest for it&#39;s people.  Please accept my <br/>comment and  do the right thing.  Thank you.
