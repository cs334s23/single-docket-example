Instead they should create a premium processing <br/>for family unification forms such as I-130 or I-129F as to provide people with money to <br/>process their cases faster or process them normally with a standard fees.  The <br/>premium processing should bring enough money to USCIS for required resources and <br/>to reduce backlogs.  <br/><br/>Permanent resident (Green Card Holders) generally pays federal &amp; state taxes for up <br/>to five years before they qualify for citizenship so they should not be penalized with <br/>outragious fees when they decide to become a US citizen.<br/><br/>Premium processing have been in place for non-immigrant petitions and they are not <br/>available for any immigrant petitions and that is why a citizen has to wait years to bring <br/>their foreign spouses to USA.  By introducing premium processing for 1-130 (spouse) <br/>USCIS could get the extra money it needs while cutting I-130 backlogs.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a1ea", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:48:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T03:30:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021a1ea", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1797/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1797/attachments"}}}}}
