Now because of the delays in Chinese adoptions, I will have to re-<br/>apply for this petition to bring my future daughter into the US. I have already paid <br/>the high cost for this once, but to have to pay it again with an increase is going to <br/>be a financial burden not only for me, but for others in my position.
