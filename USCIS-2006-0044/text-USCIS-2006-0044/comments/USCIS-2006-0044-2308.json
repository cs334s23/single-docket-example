It is a very difficult process emotionally and <br/>very expensive, even with tax credits.  Because fingerprints and I600As expire very <br/>often before the adoption process is completed, families are forced to not only add <br/>to the frustration of the process by needlessly repeating these processes, but to <br/>pay all over again as well!  Now these new fee increasese will make this already <br/>horrible process even more of a burden on adoptive families!  I urge you to <br/>PLEASE reconsider this rule change for adoptive families, who are caught up in a <br/>system that is already frustrating enough!
