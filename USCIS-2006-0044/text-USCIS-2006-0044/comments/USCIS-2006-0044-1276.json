We are sending this request to please beg you not <br/>to  raise the fees on fingerprinting and the I-600A.<br/>We started this process in June of 2005 and are still waiting for a child.  <br/>I know you can not put a price on a child but this whole process has been very over whelming <br/>and very emotional.<br/>After 3 surgeries and years of Fertility Doctors, of which insurance does not pay for and all the <br/>money spent towards adopting a child, raising these fees will be just another brick in the wall <br/>between us and a family.<br/>Our agency is telling us it could still be another year and yes we will have to pay these fees <br/>AGAIN! <br/>There are no words to decribe the feeling each day, waiting and waiting for a child.  Please, <br/>please open your hearts please do not raise these fees.<br/>Thank you<br/>Jane and Larry Cremeans<br/>   <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480213cb5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-15T18:00:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-15T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-14T17:41:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jane and Larry Cremeans", "trackingNbr": "80213cb5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1276/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1276/attachments"}}}}}
