It<br/>is clear that the government is trying to pass along the cost of increased<br/>security mandated by the government after 9/11 on to both citizens and<br/>would-be-citizens. Obviously the president and the administration did not budget<br/>sufficient funds to cover all the increased costs associated with creating the<br/>new homeland security department, increasing border security, and tightening all<br/>manner of immigration regulations. The funding deficits are now being passed on<br/>to the consumers, who had no say in the new govt policies and units.<br/><br/>I am particularly opposed to the proposed 23% increase in the filing fee for the<br/>I-600/I-600A form, the Petition for Advance Processing of Orphans. International<br/>adoption is already an outrageously expensive undertaking, and raising the fees<br/>by this inordinate amount when the fee increases over previous two 4-year<br/>periods have been between 14% and 18%, and the last such fee increase was less<br/>than two years ago, is adding an unfair burden to what is already a substantial<br/>financial hardship for many families.<br/><br/>I am strongly opposed to this fee increase, and believe USCIS should not<br/>penalize citizens trying to adopt orphans from developing countries by raising<br/>this fee over 20% in an attempt to recover more of its increased costs since<br/>9/11. Those costs must be born by the administration that mandated the changes.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Rita C.
