My husband and I are in the process of adopting from <br/>China and the fees that we&#39;ve already had to pay are quite enough.  All we want to <br/>do is give an unwanted child a home and complete our family and the costs <br/>involved in doing so are already expensive enough.  What you do need to work on <br/>is extending the expiration of the I-171H to 24 months instead of 18 months as the <br/>time to process the adoptions from China and other countries are steadily <br/>increasing.  Please reconsider this ruling and make it easier rather than difficult for <br/>families wanting to give children a home &amp; future.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219ef4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:52:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:46:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Valerie Kolle", "trackingNbr": "80219ef4", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1709/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1709/attachments"}}}}}
