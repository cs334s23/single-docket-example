My wife <br/>and I are currently in the process of adopting a baby girl from China.  After months <br/>of collecting the appropriate documents in addition to the numerous fee&#39;s <br/>associated with every certification and authentication, this proposed fee increase <br/>will drastically and negatively affect my family.  As you are aware, as is, the <br/>adoption process is a very expensive endeavor with all the local, state and federal <br/>fee&#39;s required.  The proposed fee increase would not only make adopting <br/>unattainable for many families, but it would also crush the children who would <br/>have otherwise had a successful, healthy future.  Me and my family strongly <br/>oppose the fee increase and we urge that you take our considerations to heart.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time...the Kim family.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c32a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:51:20Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T19:19:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tommy Kim", "trackingNbr": "8021c32a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2234/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2234/attachments"}}}}}
