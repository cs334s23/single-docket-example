This policy is directly opposed to the<br/>American value of fairness &amp; to the principle that the U.S. is a nation of<br/>immigrants.  It is shameful that USCIS is attempting to earn money from the<br/>poorest persons who come to fulfill the American dream and to limit even further<br/>person&#39;s ability to become citizens:  we should be encouraging, not<br/>discouraging, immigrants to become full participating citizens of the U.S. <br/>Moreover, this very process for persons to comment seems designed to exclude the<br/>participation of many people, especially the illiterate or new immigrants with<br/>limited English or limited computer skills.  There should be a number which<br/>persons could call to give their comments:  this comment process is undemocratic<br/>and has built in mechanism for those most affected to be least likely to have input.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bcbd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T20:26:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T19:52:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cristina M.
