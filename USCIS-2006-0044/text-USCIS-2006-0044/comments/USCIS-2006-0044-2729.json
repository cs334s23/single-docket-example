I think that a person who has already paid <br/>fees for adoption should be able to RENEW their filing and not have to do a <br/>completely new permit when the adoption is delayed for reasons beyond their <br/>control. In addition, I can&#39;t understand why the adoption fees are being increased <br/>over 140%. That is ridiculous. Please allow families adopting to renew their filing <br/>and please don&#39;t increase the current fees beyond what is reasonably necessary <br/>(not 140%!). Thank you.
