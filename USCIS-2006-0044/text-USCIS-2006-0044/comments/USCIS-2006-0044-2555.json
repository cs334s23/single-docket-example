Today the<br/>exact same form costs a prospective adoptive parent $545. Biometric<br/>fingerprinting, which began in 1998, has risen in cost from $25 to<br/>$70 per applicant. For a two-parent family adopting a single child,<br/>the USCIS processing fees costs an upward of $685. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in<br/>processing applications and with its customer service. Processing<br/>throughout the regional offices is erratic ? some I-600A applications<br/>take months to process, while individuals in other districts received<br/>approval of the exact same form within ten days. Adoptive parents attempting to<br/>learn the status of their petition are met with deaf ears or directed to a<br/>&quot;status&quot; website which is not updated. As a result of USCIS&#39; refusal to<br/>prioritize orphan petitions, thousands of children suffer needlessly. <br/><br/>Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers (I-140) and<br/>employment authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 and 1.97 months,<br/>respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned child (3.39 months). There is<br/>no explanation for why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected 859,543<br/>I-765 and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A applicants.<br/>Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given greater scrutiny than<br/>adult foreign workers?<br/><br/>There has been no move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive parents whose<br/>documents &quot;expire&quot; while they wait for their child&#39;s home country to grant them<br/>approval to travel. These parents are forced to reapply<br/>with USCIS, repaying the same exorbitant fees two and sometimes three<br/>additional times, each time subjecting themselves to the same long<br/>and uncertain wait for immigration approval. If USCIS would simply<br/>extend the &quot;expiration&quot; deadline for the I-171H from eighteen months to three<br/>years, it would significantly reduce itsworkload without having to increase its<br/>fees. <br/><br/>Because of the instability concurrent with international adoption, many families<br/>find that their USCIS approval expires prior to their invitation to<br/>travel to their prospective child&#39;s birth country. As a result, many<br/>families (including those adopting from Poland, Lithuania, and now China and<br/>Guatemala) find themselves repeating the entire immigration application two or<br/>three times.  My husband and I had to submit twice for the 2006 adoption of our<br/>son. This can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars ? money<br/>many of us simply do not have. USCIS rules require that the application be<br/>submitted from scratch, there is no ?renewal? option.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for<br/>what it needs, it is asking for what it wants. It claims that this<br/>fee increase &quot;is designed to provide for an adequate and sustainable<br/>level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and processes<br/>designed to improve the USCIS&#39; ability to administer the nation&#39;s<br/>immigration laws.&quot; The Bureau justifies these increases by asserting<br/>that &quot;this fee rule would provide the necessary resources to maintain<br/>these processing time standards and fund further improvements to<br/>USCIS business operations to continue to reduce processing times<br/>while ensuring the appropriate level of security.&quot;<br/><br/>There are very few infants infiltrating Al-Qaeda. The idea that<br/>adoptive parents are a threat to national security is laughable.<br/>While we agree with the aims of the Department of Homeland Security,<br/>the additional levels of scrutiny on orphaned children and their<br/>prospective parents is absurd.<br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity<br/>fraud, improving service, changing benefit applications from paper to<br/>electronic means in order to streamline the process) forcing adoptive<br/>parents to bear the burden of these goals is unconscionable. Worse<br/>still, many of USCIS&#39; stated aims do not directly benefit those<br/>seeking to immigrate.<br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and<br/>loss, and are mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings<br/>to bring home a child. Increasing the burden on us is not simply<br/>unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of waiting children. I urge<br/>rejection of the current proposal and instead propose a new requirement that<br/>USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first priority to<br/>I-600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork required for orphan<br/>petitions, and extend the &quot;expiration&quot; of the I-171H from eighteen months to<br/>three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Regina Murphy Pollock<br/>526 N President Ave<br/>Lancaster PA 17603<br/>717-399-9288<br/>rmprhp@yahoo.com<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dd5a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T17:58:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T18:03:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "n/a", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Regina Polluck", "trackingNbr": "8021dd5a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2555/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2555/attachments"}}}}}
