My husband and I are <br/>patiently waiting to adopt from China (and the wait continues to increase!).  It took <br/>many years for us to save the money to be able to begin this process.  Now we <br/>are being told that with our fingerprints expiring, we&#39;ll have to incur addition fees, <br/>and now on top of that, those addition fees - which we did not plan for - will also <br/>increase.  It was hard enough for us to come up with the funds to adopt, please <br/>don&#39;t make it any harder.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>Tracy Presepe<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020898d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:42:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T15:20:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tracy M.
