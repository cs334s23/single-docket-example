Most adoptive parents will have to go through FBI <br/>fingerprinting and USCIS I-600/I-600A approval at least twice for the adoption of <br/>the same child due to the increasing length of the waiting times imposed by the <br/>country from which they are adopting.  <br/><br/>While the document expiration for the USCIS approval is a different issue from the <br/>fee increase, they are interrelated.  If the Congress and USCIS would change the <br/>length that the documents are valid to accommodate the lengthening times for <br/>most families to complete international adoption, then a small fee increase is not <br/>as objectionable.  As it is though, the proposed fee increase is almost 23% which <br/>is higher than most businesses would increase their fees to cover costs in a <br/>single year.  <br/><br/>The frustrating part of having to resubmit the I-600/I-600 A forms is that generally  <br/>most families have little or no change to include in the resubmission.  There are <br/>additional forms that have to submitted which also need to be more current, thus <br/>adding additional costs to the adoption process (birth certificates and marriage <br/>license and an updated homestudy).   If the length of time that these documents <br/>are valid cannot be increased to accommodate the the actual time it takes to <br/>adopt, then the fees for resubmission should be part of the original costs or a very <br/>SMALL renewal fee should be charged.  In most cases, families have to travel to a <br/>USCIS Center which also requires time out of work and travel costs.<br/><br/>Again, I am opposed to an increased in these fees, especially given the fact that <br/>the USCIS knows that most families are having to pay these fees TWICE as it is.  <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ec56", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T14:25:01Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T14:10:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sue", "trackingNbr": "8021ec56", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2750/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2750/attachments"}}}}}
