The increases proposed in this <br/>rule are unreasonable and overly burdensome.  My first adoption took place in <br/>1996, the second in 1998-9, the third in 2002 and the fourth started in 2006 and I <br/>hope to complete it this year.  Each time the fees have been larger and each time <br/>the timeframes have been longer for the exact same service.  I have seen no <br/>increase in the service level with the enormous increase in fees. <br/><br/>Please, please do not implement these increases!!    <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a5cd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:49:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T12:07:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "self", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Heather A.
