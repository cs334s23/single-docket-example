Today the exact <br/>same form costs a prospective adoptive parent $545. Biometric <br/>fingerprinting, which began in 1998, has risen in cost from $25 to <br/>$70 per applicant. For a two-parent family adopting a single child, <br/>the USCIS process costs an upward of $685. Because of the instability <br/>concurrent with international adoption, many families find that their <br/>USCIS approval expires prior to their invitation to travel to their <br/>prospective child&#39;s birth country. As a result, many families <br/>(especially those adopting from China and Guatemala) find themselves <br/>repeating the entire immigration application two or three times. This <br/>can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars ? money <br/>many of us simply do not have. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing <br/>applications and with its customer service. Processing throughout the <br/>regional offices is erratic ? some I-600A applications take months to <br/>process, while individuals in other districts received approval of <br/>the exact same form within ten days. The refusal of officials to give <br/>adoptive parents priority results in children languishing in <br/>orphanages or foster care overseas for months and months at a time. <br/>Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers (I-<br/>140) and employment authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 <br/>and 1.97 months, respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned <br/>child (3.39 months). There is no explanation for<br/>why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected 859,543 I-765 <br/>and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A <br/>applicants. <br/><br/>Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given greater <br/>scrutiny than adult foreign workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are <br/>met with deaf ears and directed to a &quot;status&quot; website which is not <br/>updated. As a result of USCIS&#39; refusal to prioritize orphan <br/>petitions, thousands of children suffer needlessly. There has been no <br/>move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive parents whose <br/>documents &quot;expire&quot; while they wait for their child&#39;s home country to <br/>grant them approval to travel. These parents are forced to reapply <br/>with USCIS, repaying the same exorbitant fees two and sometimes three <br/>additional times, each time subjecting themselves to the same long <br/>and uncertain wait for immigration approval. If USCIS would simply <br/>extend the &quot;expiration&quot; deadline for the I-171H from <br/>eighteen months to 24 months, it would significantly reduce its <br/>workload without <br/>having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for what <br/>it needs, it is asking for what it wants. It claims that this fee <br/>increase &quot;is designed to provide for an adequate and sustainable <br/>level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and processes <br/>designed to improve the USCIS&#39; ability to administer the nation&#39;s <br/>immigration laws.&quot; The Bureau justifies these increases by asserting <br/>that &quot;this fee rule would provide the necessary resources to maintain <br/>these processing time standards and fund further improvements to <br/>USCIS business operations to continue to reduce processing times <br/>while ensuring the appropriate level of security.&quot;<br/><br/>There are very few infants infiltrating Al-Qaeda. The idea that <br/>adoptive parents are a threat to national security is laughable. <br/>While we agree with the aims of the Department of Homeland Security, <br/>the additional levels of scrutiny on orphaned children and their <br/>prospective parents is absurd. <br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity <br/>fraud, improving service, changing benefit applications from paper to <br/>electronic means in order to streamline the process) forcing adoptive <br/>parents to bear the burden of these goals is unconscionable. Worse <br/>still, many of USCIS&#39; stated aims do not directly benefit those <br/>seeking to immigrate. <br/><br/>While some families adopt due to infertility, others of us simply want to provide <br/>homes to children who desperately need a family. Increasing the burden on us is <br/>not simply <br/>unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of waiting children. We urge <br/>rejection of the current proposal and a new requirement that USCIS <br/>reduce the fee burden on adoptive <br/>families, give first priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate <br/>the paperwork required for orphan petitions, and extend <br/>the &quot;expiration&quot; of the I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Stephanie Tait<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e2d9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:53:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T13:00:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Stephanie Tait", "trackingNbr": "8021e2d9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2634/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2634/attachments"}}}}}
