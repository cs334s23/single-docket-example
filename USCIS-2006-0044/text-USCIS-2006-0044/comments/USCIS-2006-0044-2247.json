As an adoptive parent, I cannot <br/>express how much this would negatively impact the future of adoptions! <br/><br/>International adoption is sometimes the only option that couples have to complete <br/>the family they have always dreamed of, as is the case for my husband and me. <br/>We are advocates for the matching of couples who seek hard and long to become <br/>parents, and the children who never had a chance to experience the presence of a <br/>loving mother and father to guide their lives. Without adoption, millions of children <br/>would remain in orphanages and have less chance at a positive life ? thus <br/>increasing dependence upon the government.<br/><br/>I guess my purpose here is not to convince you that adoption is the right thing to <br/>do, but rather to convey the fact that making this process more difficult by raising <br/>fees effects more than the pocketbook, it sends a message that the government <br/>does not see children as important and worthy of assistance when they most need <br/>it.<br/><br/>Sure, there are many other costs in our lives that are increasing and we do our <br/>best to meet those demands, but adoption is where people stick their necks out to <br/>take into their homes children who otherwise would be under the government?s <br/>care ? and they provide for those children in every way ? especially financially. <br/>Now, this takes financial responsibility AWAY from the government ? we should <br/>PROMOTE this activity!<br/><br/>Please re-consider this increase of fees, because it will absolutely change the <br/>positive landscape of adoption to one of crushing financial obstacles so that only <br/>the extremely wealthy will have this option. The costs of adoption are already very <br/>high, and these increases will only cause more problems in our society and those <br/>of other countries around the world!<br/><br/>Signed,<br/>Mrs. Barbara Osness<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c4e9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:57:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T22:28:43Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Barbara Osness", "trackingNbr": "8021c4e9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2247/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2247/attachments"}}}}}
