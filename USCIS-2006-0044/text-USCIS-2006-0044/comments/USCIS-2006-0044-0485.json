Look at your<br/>trend: You introduced PERM with more charges and screwed up the 1-140 and 485<br/>stage, you followed it by 140 premium processing with 1000 dollars more but not<br/>allow people to apply for the final stage. This department is nothing but a<br/>money sucking machine. To say the least, you should be ashamed of yourselves to<br/>play with lives of individuals who travel from miles away.<br/><br/>Green Card is a mirage. The employers offer it as a dog bone and we end up<br/>wagging our tail initially. Once we are in, we are stuck. No promotions, No wage<br/>increase, no professional freedom.<br/><br/>The least you could do when you do not perform your job effectively is to not<br/>hang someone else up. Please stop this looting. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207bc0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T18:46:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T19:39:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Suren R.", "trackingNbr": "80207bc0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0485/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0485/attachments"}}}}}
