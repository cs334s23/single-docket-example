An <br/>adoption is an expensive affair and adoptions from China are an incredibly long <br/>process.  Right now, it appears we will have to re-do our I171H because the wait <br/>time is going to exceed the validity of the I171H we already have.  That means <br/>that there is more money we have to put out that could otherwise be spent on <br/>raising our new daughter...and now it may cost us more?  It is not as though we <br/>do not appreciate the work that your agency does to aid us in bringing our new <br/>daughter home to the United States, but we are concerned of the costs involved.  <br/>If a rate increase meant perhaps a longer validity of the I171H, then perhaps it <br/>would be worth it.  This journey for us is long, hard and expensive, but the reward <br/>is priceless.  We would appreciate it if you would consider not raising the rates.  <br/>We thank you for the opportunity to express our thoughts.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802077a3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:52:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T15:55:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "not applicable", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Heather M.
