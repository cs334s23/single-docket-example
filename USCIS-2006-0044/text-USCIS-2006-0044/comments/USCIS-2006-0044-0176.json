To <br/>increase the adjustment of status application from around $300 to over $900 is <br/>unfair.  This is about family reunification and to force US citizens and permanent <br/>residents to pay such high fees to do what&#39;s right and what&#39;s legal (i.e. legalize <br/>their status) is insulting and degrading.  I see how hardworking the immigrants in <br/>my community are and I think their money would be better spent on their family&#39;s <br/>well-being and society as a whole rather than on fees. If the family unit is <br/>supposedly the underlying backbone of this country, this drastic fee increase will <br/>only undermine that and have devastating effects in many respects.  I urge you to <br/>reconsider this method of &quot;enhancing service&quot; and not raise the fees in such an <br/>insulting way.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Melissa Ewer<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa6b4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T20:49:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-05T19:13:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Melissa M.
