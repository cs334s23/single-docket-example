The entire international adoption process <br/>is extremely expensive, and often takes a couple of years to complete.  Because <br/>of very strict and specific rules set by the foreign countries, adoptive families often <br/>have to re-file their paperwork to ensure it is current enough to meet those <br/>requirements.  For example, Vietnam will not accept documents that are over 6 <br/>months old.  I am currently on the waiting list for a child from Vietnam, and my <br/>paperwork will expire long before I am matched with a child.  USCIS will already <br/>get at least double money from me because of these guidelines that will require <br/>me to re-file my paperwork.  I cannot see any reason why the fees need to be <br/>increased, especially by so much.  Adoptive families already have to go through <br/>so much to have an opportunity to add a child to their lives.  Please do not make <br/>the journey any more difficult than it already is.
