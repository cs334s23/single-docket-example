Nothing justifies such price increase (for <br/>example I-485 ~300%???). I see it as a pre-emtive move to set the prices high, so <br/>when the new immigration reform bill passes there will be 12 million (currently illegal) <br/>applicants right there. Can you see the money? If you tried to pull something like that <br/>off anywhere with regards to US citizens, you can bet you would have been voted out <br/>the next day.
