Further, I ask that the currents fees associated with a <br/>Certificate of Citizenship be waived for international adoptees entering this country <br/>with any type of visa.  <br/><br/>International adoption is expensive.  I have two small children adopted from South <br/>Korea and cannot afford to get them both a Certificate of Citizenship because the <br/>fees are so high.   If my children were adopted from China and entered the United <br/>States on an R-3 visa, the Certificate of Citizenship would be sent to them for no <br/>additional fee.  But, because my children entered this country with an R-4 visa, I <br/>must pay outrageous fees in order to obtain C.O.C.&#39;s for them.  <br/><br/>I know of many hardworking adoptive parents who have made huge sacrifices in an <br/>effort to raise the money needed for an international adoption.  To make these <br/>parents pay $200-$500 for a certificate from the government that &quot;proves&quot; they are <br/>U.S. Citizens when the federal Child Citizenship Act of 2004 grants our children <br/>citizenship is aggregious.  Many adoptees need this certificate to prove their <br/>citizenship.  The Social Security Administration requires a US passport or a <br/>C.O.C. to prove U.S. citizenship.  Both of my children are listed as &quot;resident <br/>aliens&quot; even though I have finalized their adoptions in probate court in the United <br/>States.  I have to pay additional money for documents that I do not need for any <br/>other reason in order to have my children&#39;s citizenship status changed at the <br/>SSA.  <br/><br/>Please consider waiving all fees associated with a Certificate of Citizenship for <br/>ALL internationally adopted children in this country.  <br/><br/>SIncerely,<br/>Michele Breen <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f22c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:08:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-03T01:46:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Michele Breen", "trackingNbr": "8021f22c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2881/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2881/attachments"}}}}}
