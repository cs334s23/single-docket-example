We recently received our I-797c after paying $545 for <br/>the I -600a application and $140 for our fingerprints to be done.  <br/>This of course is in addition to the roughly $10,000 that we have already spent in <br/>other government office fees (certifiation, authentication, notary) and agency fees.<br/>With the current wait times from submission of dossier to travelling to China at <br/>close to 2 years, it is almost definite that we will need to send in another I-600a <br/>application and have our fingerprints done again as they expire in 18months and <br/>15 months.  At the current fee structure, my family will have paid $1370 (not <br/>including the update of our homestudy that will need to be submitted with the I-<br/>600a application) for 2 sets of the same documents.<br/>While any amount of money is nothing in our eyes, when we are talking about our <br/>future daughter, PLEASE don&#39;t make what is already a hardship, both emotional <br/>and financial, any harder on familes who are adopting internationally.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Heather &amp; Paul<br/>Future adoptive parents<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802088fa", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T20:26:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T13:43:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "None", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Heather N.
