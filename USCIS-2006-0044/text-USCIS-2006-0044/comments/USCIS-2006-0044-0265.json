Are you kidding! First prove that you can be <br/>efficient and then we will talk. <br/>Not everyone files for an I-765 and I-131. You say so yourselves when you explain <br/>your flawed and deceiving math. However, now you want to charge everyone $905 <br/>whether one files an I-131 or not?! This does not make sense! And all this would <br/>only improve the wait times by two months?! No thanks! <br/><br/>All you are doing is discouraging immigrants to use the legal ways to come and <br/>work in this country and instead you are encouraging the illegal immigration. You <br/>will increase the number of people staying in the shadows. How can this help <br/>improve National Security?! <br/>Not all immigrants work for tech companies; most work the fields and the <br/>dishwasher at your favorite restaurant. They barely push minimum wage. Just put <br/>yourselves in their shoes for a minute, and think?..<br/><br/>USCIS is a government agency and as such should receive some government <br/>money. If not, privatize it. How about this, switch some of my tax money from <br/>paying for the war in Iraq, to funding USCIS! <br/><br/>As an American Citizen, I strongly disagree to the extent of this fee adjustment! <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fe171", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-08T22:18:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-08T21:06:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801fe171", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0265/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0265/attachments"}}}}}
