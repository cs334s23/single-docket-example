U.S. taxpayers should not <br/>have to pay for the immigration or citizenship of aliens they have no ties with.  <br/>Fees can be waived for those that have a legitimate and documented need.  For <br/>an alien to enter the U.S. or become a U.S. citizen is a priviledge, not a right.  <br/>Perhaps if it were charged accordingly, people would take it more seriously.
