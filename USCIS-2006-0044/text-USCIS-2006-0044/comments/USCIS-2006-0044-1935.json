International adoption is already a very <br/>expensive process and many families have to renew their petition one or two times <br/>paying the original amount again.  It often takes much longer than 18 months to <br/>finalize an international adoption and the I-600A approval is only good for that <br/>long.  If it is imperative to raise the fee, please consider increasing the time <br/>between renewals or charging a lower renewal fee instead of the original fee all <br/>over again.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration,<br/>Carla Lewter<br/>Adoptive Mother-to-be of a daughter from China<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab3a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:58:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T23:17:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Carla L.
