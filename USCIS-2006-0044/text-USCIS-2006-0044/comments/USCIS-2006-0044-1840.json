Our adoption cost $40,000 &amp; we did not <br/>qualify for the full $10,000 tax credit.  I don&#39;t care who you are or how much you make, $40,000 is <br/>a hit for anyone&#39;s finances - especially after paying for 6 years worth of infertility treatments.  So, I <br/>believe that the fee for the USCIS service is plenty &amp; does NOT need to be raised!!!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a741", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T18:44:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T15:16:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kim Johnson", "trackingNbr": "8021a741", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1840/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1840/attachments"}}}}}
