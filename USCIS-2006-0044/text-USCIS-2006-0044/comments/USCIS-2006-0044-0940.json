Charging <br/>$905 (a 178 percent increase) to apply for permanent residency would be an <br/>undue economic hardship for many applicants and their family members. Imagine <br/>what our country would be like today if this same fee structure had been imposed <br/>upon our own ancestors.<br/><br/>I urge USCIS to work with Congress to create an alternative and permanent <br/>funding stream that will support USCIS operations. I also urge Congress to fund <br/>immigration services and policies that benefit families rather than spend millions of <br/>dollars on arrests, detention, and deportation, which cause untold hardships for <br/>families and communities.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bbf9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T20:22:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T17:02:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Arthur Figel", "trackingNbr": "8020bbf9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0940/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0940/attachments"}}}}}
