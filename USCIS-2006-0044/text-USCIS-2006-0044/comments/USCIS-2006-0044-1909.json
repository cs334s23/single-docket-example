As a prospective adoptive <br/>parent, we have already spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to bring our <br/>daughter home from Vietnam.  We are a middle-class american family, and <br/>needless to say, the cost has made a significant impact on our finances.  <br/>Granted, many of those fees are not anything the U.S. government has control <br/>over, but some of them are directly related to USCIS policies.  The United States <br/>is known throughout the world for its compassion towards the needy, yet our <br/>govenment seems determined to make it even more difficult for individual citizens <br/>to extend one of the greatest expressions of compassion - adoption - to a orphan <br/>child.   Of particular frustration to those of us in the adoption community is the <br/>fact that our fingerprints and I-600A often expire before we have the chance to <br/>bring our children home.  This rate increase would then mean a total of $320 for 2 <br/>parents to get fingerprinted twice, and a whopping $1340 for filing the I-600A <br/>twice!  That is quite a financial burden to impose on those whose primary goal is <br/>to help a child!  I urge you to avoid discouraging U.S. citizens from adopting <br/>internationally by raising these fees, and imagine how many more children could <br/>be impacted by the love of americans if only the cost weren&#39;t so exorbinant.  <br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aa64", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T02:49:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T20:38:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Laura M.
