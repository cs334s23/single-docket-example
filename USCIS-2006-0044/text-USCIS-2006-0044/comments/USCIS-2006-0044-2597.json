We are currently in the middle of our 2nd <br/>international adoption.  The myriad of fees required is staggering, but we pay them <br/>because we love our children and feel called to adopt.  The fee we paid this winter <br/>was already substantially more than we paid in 2000 when we submitted our first <br/>I600-A.  We also waited over 3 months in 2000 and almost 2 months this winter to <br/>receive our Favorable Determination Letters (I171-H).  This winter we asked to <br/>have expedited service because our new daughter has a spine condition which <br/>needs medical attention.  It still took almost 2 months, and the approval did not <br/>leave the office for 7 days after the approval date.  If a fee must be imposed, it <br/>should lead to much better and quicker service.  The service should also be of <br/>similar time lengths at all offices.  Currently some offices approve in a week, some <br/>take several months.  Perhaps offering expedited service for an additional fee <br/>would be a solution.  Most people adopting are not wealthy and struggle to pay <br/>the fees involved, often going into debt to do so.  We are U.S. citizens who should <br/>have the opportunity to bring children into our families as we choose, and should <br/>not be continually subjected to higher and higher fees.<br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021df27", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T23:54:43Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "n/a", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sharul Rapavy", "trackingNbr": "8021df27", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2597/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2597/attachments"}}}}}
