It is unreasonable to believe that companies<br/>won&#39;t pass the cost on to the worker, so stronger laws are certainly needed.<br/><br/>As your job is not to draft laws but simply enforce them, I also believe the<br/>USCIS and DOL is negligent in enforcing the few protections that do exist.  For<br/>example,<br/>prevailing wages aren&#39;t being met and there are multiple sources used to<br/>determine the wage.  This creates a program used to deliver cheap and exploited<br/>labor, not skilled labor.  Studies have shown that H-1b workers are in fact paid<br/>below<br/>prevailing wages and nothing is being done to stop this practice.  This program<br/>makes occupations, such as software engineering, less attractive to the American<br/>workforce and has resulted in fewer admissions in Computer Science majors.<br/><br/>Department of Labor statistics show that job creation in software occupations<br/>have stagnated.  Despite this, the vast majority of H-1b and L1 visas are<br/>intended for that occupation.  The greatest users of this visa are in fact<br/>Indian outsourcing firms such as Infosys, Wipro, and Tata.  In these cases the<br/>visa is used to streamline the offshoring of high-skilled jobs.<br/><br/>I propose that the DOL and USCIS use labor statistics to better determine what<br/>occupations are eligible for the H-1b and L1 visa programs.  A detailed document<br/>is attached for review.  There is no reason that additional H-1b visas are<br/>granted to software professionals.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021258c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T14:12:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-11T02:27:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Roy Lawson, IEEE-USA and Programmers Guild Member", "trackingNbr": "8021258c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [{"id": "0900006480dff8ca", "type": "attachments"}], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1246/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1246/attachments"}}}}, "included": [{"id": "0900006480dff8ca", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/0900006480dff8ca"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 1, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCIS-2006-0044-1246/attachment_1.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 173946}], "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T10:12:58Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Roy Lawson, IEEE-USA and Programmers Guild member (Attachment)"}}]}
