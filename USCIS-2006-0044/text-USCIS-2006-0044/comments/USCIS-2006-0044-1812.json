I have to voice my <br/>disagreement with this proposal.  <br/><br/>As adoptive parents waiting to travel to China next week to pic up our new son, we <br/>found the many fees related to the adoption process somewhat of a burden on our <br/>family budget at times.  Due to the increased wait for our referral, we were <br/>required to be refingerprinted and refile our I600A, which resulted in even more <br/>expense than we had planned for.  If the fees were higher when we were going <br/>through the process, we would have found it even more difficult to give our new son <br/>the family he and every child deserves.  China is one of the more inexpensive <br/>programs, and we are still going to pay more than $30k when all is said and <br/>done.  This should be more about helping orphaned children find families, not <br/>making money.  Rather than spending time coming up with new rules and fees, <br/>the USCIS&#39;s time would be better spent changing the rules around expiration time <br/>frames for the paperwork related to adoption and make sure people do not have to <br/>refile in the middle of their adoption process.  <br/><br/>Please do not pass this proposed fee increase.  <br/><br/>Darin Fitzgerald<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a5fc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:49:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T12:44:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Darin L.
