In recent years the wait time for international adoptions has <br/>increased in various countries, including Colombia.  As a result, families like ours <br/>have been required to file Form I-600A and obtain fingerprints more than once to <br/>keep our petitions from expiring before our adoptions are completed.  Significant <br/>increases in these and other fees, as proposed, would further increase the <br/>financial responsibility for adoptive families, sometimes twofold for a single <br/>adoption.<br/><br/>Our desire is that many more children would be given the gift of loving parents and <br/>families.  We believe fee increases as proposed in the above docket will make it <br/>more difficult for families of various incomes to pursue international adoption.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering our comments.<br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/>Allan and Robyn Zafft<br/>Lee&#39;s Summit, MO<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e659", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:39:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T00:40:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Allan and Robyn Zafft", "trackingNbr": "8021e659", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2701/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2701/attachments"}}}}}
