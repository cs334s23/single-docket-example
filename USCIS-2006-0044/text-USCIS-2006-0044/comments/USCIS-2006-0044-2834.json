This would raise filing fees for services associated with international <br/>adoption.  My family is in the process of adopting from China.  We have already <br/>paid $685 to the USCIS ($545 for I-600A and $140 for fingerprints).  With the wait <br/>for our adoption increasing, we will have to renew our fingerprints and our 171-H -- <br/>this means another $685 (or more if the fees are increased) for our family.  <br/>Currently we have spent close to $10,000 for adoption expenses and fees and <br/>need another $15,000 to complete the adoption.  I would please ask that you <br/>would NOT INCREASE these fees.  International adoption is extremely expensive <br/>and adding to that expense will make the process even more difficult for families, <br/>especially when having to pay the fee twice.  Many families have to borrow money <br/>to adopt internationally -- any increased fees only increases the financial burden <br/>families are already facing.  Please reconsider this increase.  By not increasing <br/>these fees your agency will be supporting families and encouraging adoption, <br/>which provides homes and families for orphaned children around the world.  <br/>Adoption is a wonderful miracle that grows families and spreads love, please <br/>support adoption and DO NOT INCREASE THESE FEES.<br/>Thank you so much for your time and consideration in this extremely important <br/>matter.<br/>Marcy Taylor<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021efbc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:49:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Marcy Taylor", "trackingNbr": "8021efbc", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2834/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2834/attachments"}}}}}
