We <br/>make many financial sacrifices to be able to afford adoption.  We are happy to <br/>make the necessary sacrifices to have the reward of a family through adoption.<br/>The current fees for adoption are a struggle for us and many adoptive families we <br/>know.  An increase in fees would be a financial burden that we hope not to have to<br/>manage.<br/><br/>Please consider that many families already struggle with the expenses they incur <br/>so that they may have the blessing of having a family through adoption.<br/><br/>Please do not raise the fees for adoption.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Holly Krupinski <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021eb69", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T11:58:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Holly Krupinski", "trackingNbr": "8021eb69", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2740/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2740/attachments"}}}}}
