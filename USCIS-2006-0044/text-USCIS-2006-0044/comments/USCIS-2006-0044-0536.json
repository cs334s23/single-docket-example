Costs associated with the adoption process can be quite high. One such <br/>cost is related to the filing of the I-600A to obtain the I-171H. Due to the longer <br/>wait time between Dossier submission and referrals, families are having to refile <br/>for the I-171H by resubmitting their I-600A and redoing fingerprints. As is, this is <br/>very expensive. Raising the cost of filing (and biometric costs) would just add to <br/>the financial stress. <br/><br/>Please reconsider raising the costs associated with filing for the I-600A. Having to <br/>refile is already a stressful situation, please do not add to that by increasing the <br/>fees.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nicole Van Note Gower<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207f72", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T19:51:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T00:44:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Nicole Van Note Gower", "trackingNbr": "80207f72", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0536/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0536/attachments"}}}}}
