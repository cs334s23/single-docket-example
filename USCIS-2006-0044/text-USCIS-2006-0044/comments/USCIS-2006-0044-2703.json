In my case, I have already submitted paperwork to <br/>China to adopt a second daughter (we adopted my first daughter three years ago).  <br/>Because of the wait times currently associated with the China program, and the <br/>expiration dates of the paperwork required by the U.S government, it is highly likely that <br/>all adoptive parents will be subjected to a re-submission of fingerprint clearance AND <br/>the I600A form, requiring an additional $830 ($670 for a new I600A + 2 more <br/>fingerprint sets @ $80 each).  Because these fees apply only to adoptive parents for <br/>foreign countries, and because China in particular currently has waiting times in <br/>excess of U.S. government expiration periods for these documents, it effectively <br/>implements race-based and financial-state-based discrimination.  An additional $830, <br/>on top of the existing U.S. government processing fees for foreign adoption, is an <br/>excessive financial burden, on top of an already expensive process.<br/><br/>Please consider avoiding the unintended discrimination by extending the expiration date <br/>for existing and future submissions for foreign adoption, or waiving this secondary set <br/>of fees for re-processing papers which have already been processed and cleared by <br/>the government.<br/><br/>An adoptive and prospective adoptive parent,<br/>Brian Lucas<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e666", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:39:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T00:47:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Brian Lucas", "trackingNbr": "8021e666", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2703/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2703/attachments"}}}}}
