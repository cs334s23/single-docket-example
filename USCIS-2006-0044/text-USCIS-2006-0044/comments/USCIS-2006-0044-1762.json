Infertility is the primary <br/>reason many families choose to adopt abroad, and often by the time the decision <br/>to adopt is reached, finances are strained.  If we truly value the American family, <br/>why are we making it so much more difficult, even unattainable in some cases, for <br/>families to be formed through international adoption?<br/><br/>I would be happy to share out fertility and adoption story, and the joy our now 13 <br/>month old son has brought to our lives, if it will assist in striking down this unfair <br/>increase in fees.  I find it unconscionable that because we have to jump through <br/>so many hoops and file so much paperwork, the cost to provide him with an <br/>official piece of paper saying he is a citizen is going to more than double before I <br/>can finish the process.  Our dreams of completing our family with a sibling for him <br/>may be out of reach if these fee increases continue.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a089", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:03:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:55:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jennifer C.
