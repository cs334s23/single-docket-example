As a result, many families find themselves <br/>repeating the entire immigration application two or three times.  If USCIS would <br/>simply extend the &quot;expiration&quot; deadline for the I-171H from eighteen months to <br/>three years, it would significantly reduce its workload without having to increase <br/>its fees.<br/><br/>While we agree with the aims of the Department of Homeland Security, the <br/>additional level of scrutiny on orphaned children and their prospective parents is <br/>absurd.The idea that adoptive parents are a threat to national security is <br/>laughable! <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and are<br/>mortgaging homes and cleaning out life savings to bring home a child.  Increasing <br/>the burden is not simply unfair; it is detrimental to the lives of waiting children.  Is <br/>adoption only for the rich? In the words of our 5 year old adopted daughter, after <br/>being home a year, ?...but everyone deserves a family?. We urge rejection of the <br/>current proposal and a new requirement that USCIS reduce the fee burden on <br/>adoptive families, give first priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate the <br/>paperwork required for orphan petitions, and extend the &quot;expiration&quot; of the I-171H <br/>from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Brad and Kathleen Poindexter<br/>Danville, Virginia<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b856", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T23:43:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T01:50:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021b856", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2072/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2072/attachments"}}}}}
