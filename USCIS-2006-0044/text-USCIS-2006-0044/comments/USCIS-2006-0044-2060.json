I am logged in to adopt an infant in China. <br/>We have already gone through the process of one petition.  This pettiion for an<br/>advanced placemnet for an orphan will expire in a month.  The referral dates<br/>have increased dramatically since we started, 8 months now to 17 months.  This<br/>means we will have to go through the petition process again. This affects<br/>thousands of families in the U.S.  Do we need to increase fees for couples that<br/>only want to become parents.  Please consider the above and do not increase the<br/>fees   <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b7f9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T23:03:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T00:42:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Don Manzullo", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Curt Coplien", "trackingNbr": "8021b7f9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2060/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2060/attachments"}}}}}
