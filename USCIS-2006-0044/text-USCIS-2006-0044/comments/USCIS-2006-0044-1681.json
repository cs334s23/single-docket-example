To increase the filing fees for the USCIS by so <br/>much, many children and parents would never be united.  The parents simply <br/>would not be able to pay all the fees involved.  Also, with the length of the wait <br/>from most foreign countries currently, adoptive parents have to file these papers <br/>twice to have they remain valid during travel.  To increase the fees passes along a <br/>double increase to the families.  Please help these children and parents find each <br/>other.
