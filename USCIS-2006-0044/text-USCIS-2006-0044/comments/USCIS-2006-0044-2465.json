The USCIS was <br/>extremely helpful to us in our first international adoption.  Thank you for all of your <br/>assistance in bringing our precious son home.<br/><br/>I am concerned about the increased fees for the I-600A and fingerprinting. The <br/>cost to adopt a child is already extremely high and prohibitive to some families.  I <br/>ask that you please not increase this cost.  We are currently adopting from China, <br/>and due to the long wait for a child right now in China, families are having to renew <br/>their I-171H before their child is home.  So these fees will have to be paid twice <br/>within a single adoption process.  Please help assist these families who work so <br/>hard to bring these precious children into loving homes by not increasing the fees <br/>associated with immigration.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d85a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:34:22Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T01:49:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021d85a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2465/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2465/attachments"}}}}}
