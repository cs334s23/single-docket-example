I am writing to STRONGLY PROTEST the proposed fee increase by <br/>the USCIS.  During our paperchase the largest obstacles we encountered were <br/>posed by the US federal government -- the poor quality of service, the slow <br/>response, rude employees the list is endless.  For this we paid, and paid again <br/>and paid once again when they insisted on additional fingerprints (expired -- as if I <br/>were able to purchase new ones???), citizenship application fees (although a law <br/>had been passed several years earlier granting automatic citizenship to my <br/>children).  Again the list is endless and too long for this forum.<br/><br/>Adoptive parents undergo strict scrutiny from various government and quasi  <br/>government agencies before being granted permission to parent children.  We are, <br/>in fact, the &quot;perfect citizens&quot; that most countries would welcome.  We do not have <br/>criminal backgrounds, pay our taxes faithfully and do not cause &quot;problems&quot; for our <br/>representatives.  And the thanks we get for this?  Increased fees for one of the few <br/>services we request in return for our support.  The fees are already outrageous.  <br/>They would be more palatable if we received good (let&#39;s forget about excellent) <br/>service in return.  But we don&#39;t.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend that your agency respond to increased costs by looking at <br/>the expense side of your budget, not the revenut.  Cut your overhead, improve <br/>your computer systems and improve your customer service.  I also suggest a <br/>division between adoption and immigration processing.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aadd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:57:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T22:06:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sheila Woodland-McClain", "trackingNbr": "8021aadd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1924/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1924/attachments"}}}}}
