We have embraced the idea of adoption and <br/>are in the process of adopting our first child from Vietnam.  This is a process that <br/>millions never put themselves into, but a process that through love and <br/>commitment to our child, we have chosen to pursue.  When we began looking into <br/>adoption, many agencies offer these &quot;solutions&quot; for funding the process, which <br/>can easily be between $20,000 and $40,000: get home equity loans, get advances <br/>on credit cards, hold fundraisers, talk to people about making donations.  In a <br/>world where we are inundated with credit cards, debt consolidations, credit <br/>counselors, etc....why on Earth should we be put into this position because we <br/>are adopting?  Honestly, how many people giving birth are asked to make such a <br/>financial commitment?  Not to mention, the monies are all paid out before the <br/>child is even legally adopted!<br/><br/>In addition, with the ever increasing timeframes in adoption, many families have to <br/>pay these fees more than once, as the data only remain in the system for a <br/>limited amount of time!  So consider the fact that you aren&#39;t raising these fees <br/>once per adoption, but twice!<br/><br/>I strongly recommend that you reconsider the idea of raising the fees that adoptive <br/>parents must pay in order to build a family.  It&#39;s already a financial hardship on <br/>many families and why would you want to be responsible for making it worse?<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a97f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:58:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T19:16:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by J.
