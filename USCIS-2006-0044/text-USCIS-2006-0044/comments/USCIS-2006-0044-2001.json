It is ridiculous that the immigration and <br/>citizenship fees are always increasing. It is making an already long and financially <br/>burdensome process even more burdensome. I can&#39;t imagine what the ladies and <br/>gentlemen who proposed these fee increases are thinking. Obviously they have <br/>either not adopted internationally themselves or they have unlimited financial <br/>resources that it wouldn&#39;t affect them. I just don&#39;t understand why my own <br/>government wants to make this hard journey even harder for families like mine. <br/>With all that is going on around the world right now that is making international <br/>adoption even harder, I can&#39;t understand why the government of the world&#39;s leading <br/>power wants to add to that hardship.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b587", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:16:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T18:24:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Leanne Underkoffler", "trackingNbr": "8021b587", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2001/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2001/attachments"}}}}}
