A 69% (total) fee hike on citizenship <br/>applications is completely unreasonable, and will actually make it much more difficult for many of <br/>the applicants to apply.  Last I checked, we want *more* people to apply for and gain citizenship, <br/>not fewer.  Encourage them to join in and they will; don&#39;t make the wall even higher.  Marginalization <br/>is never a good thing, and this proposal will promote that.<br/><br/>Please reconsider your position; there should be other ways to recoup, reduce or reverse increases <br/>in operating costs.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Brian Lewin<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e7ba", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T05:43:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Brian Lewin", "trackingNbr": "8021e7ba", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2732/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2732/attachments"}}}}}
