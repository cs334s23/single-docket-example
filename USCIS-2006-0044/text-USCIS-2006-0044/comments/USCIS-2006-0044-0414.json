I am in the process of adopting a child from China.  I <br/>completed my I600A form and had my fingerprints taken at this time last year and <br/>paid all appropriate fees.  Due to the fact that China is now taking almost two <br/>years to complete the adoption process I am going to have to re-file my I600A <br/>form and be re-fingerprinted.  This is not fair but that is what the law says I must <br/>do.  But to now increase this fees is putting salt in the wound.  I suggest that the <br/>fees remain the same for those people who are re-applying.  It is only fair.<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing me to express my views.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Mary D.
