As you probably know the<br/>wait time until an adoption match is received has grown so much that he 18 month<br/>time period for the 171-H is not sufficient.  So we will have to pay the I-600<br/>fee twice.  I understand that you are responding to your budget problems with a<br/>fee increase.  But adoptive parents and advocacy groups appealed to the USCIS<br/>last year in regards to the wait time issue with China.  There were hearings and<br/>some talk about an extension process but it seems that your only response was<br/>just to raise the fees.  So I appeal to you that if these fees are raised and I<br/>assume they will be that you offer an opportunity for us to file an<br/>extension(with no or a small fee) of our I-171H rather than taking advantage of<br/>our unfortunate situation.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Angela R Smith<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480209589", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:48:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-19T18:35:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Angela R.
