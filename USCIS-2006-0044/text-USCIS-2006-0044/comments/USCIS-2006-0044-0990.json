I am currently in the <br/>process of adopting a daughter from China.  I&#39;ve already paid the immagration fee <br/>and submitted all of my ppwk, but since the ppwk is only good for 18 months, I will <br/>have to re-apply since we will probably not be home from China before our 171-H <br/>expires.  It seems we are being penalized for things that are out of our hands, and <br/>this is already an emotional and expensive process as it is.  If you are not going to <br/>extend the 171-H time to 24 months, then for those who have already applied I <br/>suggest a lower fee or renewal fee of $50 since we have already submitted and <br/>been approved on our ppwk, so we don&#39;t have to be penalized by such a large fee <br/>for our adoption.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that we have to pay this fee twice and since <br/>we already where approved once our submitions should be easily approved the <br/>second time.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020cc38", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-01T21:10:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-01T20:24:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Karen Rainey", "trackingNbr": "8020cc38", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0990/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0990/attachments"}}}}}
