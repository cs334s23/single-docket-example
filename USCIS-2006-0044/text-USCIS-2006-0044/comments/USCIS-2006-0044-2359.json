Adopting a child is a <br/>process that takes great consideration and expense.  As a single parent adopting <br/>from a foreign country it has become increasingly difficult to deal with due to time <br/>delays in adopting a child and then for USCIS to increase its fees and penalize <br/>those waiting parents seems a bit unfair.  I feel that an organization should not be <br/>able to profit off of something that is beyond the control of the waiting parent.  I <br/>think that increasing the fees in order to adopt a child will only increase the <br/>problems already being face by the many children waiting for their forever families, <br/>families not being able to afford to adopt, therefore leaving many of these children <br/>in the system.  I feel that the goal should be to find loving homes for these children <br/>and not to profit from the delays being imposed by the foreign countries.  I would <br/>prefer to use this money to give a child a better life than to pay someone to to <br/>reprocess an application already filed that should have been adequate in the first <br/>place.  I hope the USCIS will reconsider their proposed increased fees and think of <br/>the children needing homes and not an increase in revenue.  The goal should be to <br/>decrease the wait time and get these children to their forever familes.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cf26", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2008-04-04T16:29:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T18:46:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Janet K.
