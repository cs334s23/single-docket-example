We paid <br/>the filing fee and the fingerprinting fee. Due to the long wait for the adoption and <br/>the expiration dates of the I-171H and the fingerprints we will have to again pay the <br/>fees. <br/><br/>Adoption is expensive and the increase in fees creates a hardship on families <br/>willing to give these children a chance in life. Not all families that adopt <br/>internationally are wealthy.<br/><br/>If the increase is approved I would ask that you extend the expiration of the I-171H <br/>to two (2) years.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my opinion. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021eddd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T16:43:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by S.B.", "trackingNbr": "8021eddd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2781/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2781/attachments"}}}}}
