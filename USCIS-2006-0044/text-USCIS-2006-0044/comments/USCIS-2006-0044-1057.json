As citizens of the United States who are trying to make a <br/>difference in this worldl by helping others...why must we continue to be penalized!<br/><br/>I have just less than a year ago paid for both my husbands and my fingerprints.  <br/>We have paid a considerable sum ALL FOR NOTHING! Only to be told again that <br/>we must pay again.  There has been no changes in our lives...we have not <br/>committed a crime since our last fingerprints were taken...so why must we repeat <br/>the same costly process again?  This is a scam as for as I am concerned!<br/>Yes, I am angry, but more so, I am confused and feel scammed!  Not only are we <br/>being required to repeat the same process but now we are being required to pay <br/>more...FOR WHAT!  We are not rich or even wealthy...we live from paycheck to <br/>paycheck like most of the rest of the world.  Why are we made to suffer because <br/>we want to help raise a child who have no parents! If anything the government <br/>should be commending us and offering to help us help others.  Instead we are <br/>being scammed by our own government!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020d5ec", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-02T19:04:22Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-02T17:26:08Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Ovada M.
