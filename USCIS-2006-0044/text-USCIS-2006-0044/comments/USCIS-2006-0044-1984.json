Each year, we pay slightly less than half our income in taxes <br/>and from the remaining 57% we donate to organizations that provide grants to couples who wish to <br/>adopt. It is more than a little frustating to know that a significant portion of the grant monies <br/>received will then go back to the government rather than to organizations actually providing orphan <br/>care. It is our hope that by increasing the efficiency of the USCIS, these cost increases will be <br/>unnecessary. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b4fc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:11:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T17:22:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rhonda Bowers", "trackingNbr": "8021b4fc", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1984/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1984/attachments"}}}}}
