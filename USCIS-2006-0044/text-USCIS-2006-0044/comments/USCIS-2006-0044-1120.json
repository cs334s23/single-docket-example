Well that <br/>is because immigrants-more illegal than legal-keep flowing in so new backlog is <br/>created before old one is eliminated. USCIS has been doing a great job.<br/><br/>The fee will be at most $1,000. It is not inability to pay either as immigrants <br/>happily pay their attorney anywhere between $5000 and $15,000 for simple green <br/>card cases and tens of thousands for deportation cases. Then why are <br/>they &quot;unable&quot; to pay the government an appropriate amount? Or are they <br/>unwilling? Then they should not be seeking immigration benefits in this country. <br/><br/>Most importantly, it is unfair that taxpayers should pay for the benefits somebody <br/>else is seeking; we have to do so in enough areas. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480211ae8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-12T20:28:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-12T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-10T00:24:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80211ae8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1120/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1120/attachments"}}}}}
