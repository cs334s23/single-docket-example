It has come to<br/>our attention that our I 171-H form will expire before we return home with our<br/>child. Already faced with the expense of the adoption process as well as<br/>preparing for her arrival, we are faced with not only submitting another form,<br/>but with the increase in fees, which we find outrageous. Can you please tell us,<br/>did our fingerprints change? How can anyone justify these fees? Why is it not<br/>possible to extend our form as long as needed. Why is our own government making<br/>it so difficult for us to complete this process?
