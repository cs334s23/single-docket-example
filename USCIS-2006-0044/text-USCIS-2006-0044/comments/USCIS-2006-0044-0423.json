And those people ought to be encouraged <br/>and not discouraged by high costly fees which give a VERY UNWELCOMING <br/>odor to the encounter with our country and the immigration service!!!  I am <br/>definitely not for illegal aliens coming to our country!  But, for those who choose to <br/>come the legal legitimate way, they ought to be welcomed(within reason <br/>concerning security for our country)!  In fact , the process ough to be made more <br/>stream lined and welcoming!   So, I am against raising already too high <br/>processing fees!!!!
