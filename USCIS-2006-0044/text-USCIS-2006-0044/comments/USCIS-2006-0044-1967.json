This <br/>process is very expensive and very long. Documents expire in the meantime and have to be <br/>redone, which adds to the cost. I feel it is grossly unfair to raise fees for United States citizens who <br/>are trying to better a child&#39;s life and theirs. The long international adoption process takes its toll on <br/>those warm-hearted people who are involved in it. Please do not make their lives more difficult by <br/>raising fees. Anything you can do to make this process easier, not harder, is most appreciated.<br/>Thank you.<br/>Judith Stanhope<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b425", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:10:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T15:45:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Judith E.
