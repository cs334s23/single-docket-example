I oppose<br/>the proposed increase in Immigration Application Fees. I am presently employed<br/>by a small business. Small businesses in this country are very much in need of<br/>high-skilled workers to expand their businesses and to stay competitive, two<br/>very critical factors for small businesses. One of the factors that are a turn<br/>off to small businesses while employing foreign workers is the complexity and<br/>the financial investment involved with the entire process. From personal<br/>experience, I am finding out that it takes a great deal of time in explantation<br/>of the entire process and to obtain various information needed for the<br/>application and to convince them to justify the cost for all of this. By<br/>increasing the application fees, which is unjust as some of them are nearly<br/>double the previous amount, I belive that many small businesses around the<br/>nation are put in a disadvantageous position , when the need arises for them to<br/>employ high skilled immigrants. I hope that the concerned parties reconsider<br/>their position on this matter. Thank you. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206651", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T00:22:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T19:33:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80206651", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0399/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0399/attachments"}}}}}
