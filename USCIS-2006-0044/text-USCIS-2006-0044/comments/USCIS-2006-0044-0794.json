Either extend the length of <br/>time fingerprints are good, or allow us to apply for extension for nominal fee - but <br/>please don&#39;t increase the fees for applications at this time!  The fees were just <br/>increased when we started the process for our first daughter just 3 years ago and <br/>now another one?    <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a5f0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-22T14:14:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-22T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-22T02:52:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Stacy DeLore", "trackingNbr": "8020a5f0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0794/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0794/attachments"}}}}}
