The costs of adoption are varied and extensive.<br/>Most adoptive parents are not wealthy and bear the entire cost of the process<br/>themselves. For a family seeking to adopt a sibling pair or group, these fees<br/>can contribute to making it prohibitive. <br/><br/>The costs of parenting are borne over time and can be managed. The costs of<br/>meeting fee schedules (and there are many different schedules when adopting) is<br/>complicated because it is out of the family&#39;s control. To make the cost of the<br/>adoption process the deciding factor in determining whether a sibling set gets a<br/>family or spends their entire lives in an orphanage is callous.<br/><br/>Please consider the impact of these proposed increases on the lives of real<br/>people rather than solely on the budget.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Rebecca<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e2ef", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:53:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T13:17:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rebecca Sheeham", "trackingNbr": "8021e2ef", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2636/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2636/attachments"}}}}}
