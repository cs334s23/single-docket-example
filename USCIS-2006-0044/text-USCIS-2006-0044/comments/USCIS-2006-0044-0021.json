Similar adjustments have<br/>been made several times in the past decade, however the processing time of<br/>immigration visa has become longer and longer. Based on what I have seen in the<br/>past 10 years, I am not convinced that proposed adjustment will improve the<br/>USCIS service. <br/><br/>USCIS is a government agency and its overhead shouldn&#39;t be covered by<br/>application and petition fee. Just like the police department shouldn&#39;t count on<br/>speeding tickets to cover its overhead or equipment upgrade. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f97f4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T19:15:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T18:16:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Liang Yin, Universal Instruments Corp.", "trackingNbr": "801f97f4", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0021/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0021/attachments"}}}}}
