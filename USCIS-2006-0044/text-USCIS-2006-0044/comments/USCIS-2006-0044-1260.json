An <br/>increase in the fees will only encourage more document fraud and illegal entry as <br/>it will close the door to those who the US has the most problem with, the <br/>Seasonal and Temporary Workers for which much debate has been had to make <br/>a guest worker visa.   Most of the proposed fees raise those that are most vital <br/>and important to continue smooth immigration and to get the majority of <br/>immigrants on the right track.  It will target individuals, not companies, who are <br/>not best or able to cover such expenses.   While it should be noted that <br/>citizenship costs alot to administer, it costs more to continue to monitor residents <br/>as the comply with registration, moves, commit crimes, and other problems.  As <br/>residents become citizens, the load of supervision the Agency must monitor <br/>becomes less.  Why discourage those who would qualify?  Similarly why increase <br/>adjustments so high that it is cheaper to buy really good looking documents on <br/>the street?  <br/><br/>Most of my clients complain about my fees in addition to the already large fees to <br/>adjudicate applications.  However, corporate clients, while complain are more than <br/>willing to pay the fees if they get quality service.  That is not happening right now <br/>and until it does, the fees should not change.   Aliens and corporations should not <br/>pay for the wall that Congress has already allocated money for.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480213106", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T15:52:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-13T00:55:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Steven Lawrence", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Steven R.
