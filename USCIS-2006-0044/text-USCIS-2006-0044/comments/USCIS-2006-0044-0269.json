I would really appreciate if you can <br/>a little be reasonable with I-140 and I-485 filing fee because this is a really <br/>enormous increase. All employers are already spending lots of money on H1B <br/>sponsorship every 3 years or every year due to backlog especially on behalf of  <br/>Indian / Chinese nationals and on PERM application. With this ruling there will be <br/>an added burden on employers. This would also affect advancement of immigrants. <br/>This is just my honest opinion. I also understand your socio-economic <br/>responsibilities towards the nation but at the same time I would really request you <br/>to be reasonable with filing fee etc..Thank you very much.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fefbb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-09T20:05:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-09T14:15:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Alpesh M.
