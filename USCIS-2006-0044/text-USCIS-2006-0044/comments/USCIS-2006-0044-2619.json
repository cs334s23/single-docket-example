The rate increases are <br/>exhorbitant; it would be more equitable to gradually increase the rates on an as-<br/>needed basis.  It is clear that the negative impact of these rate increases will <br/>affect exclusively those immigrants who can least afford them.  The proposed <br/>steep rate increases seem philosophically contrary to our nation&#39;s &quot;open door <br/>policy&quot; that has traditionally welcomed immigrants and the contributions they have <br/>made and continue to make to our country.  I advocate that these fees not be <br/>increased at this time to the levels proposed--in some cases to an exhorbitant <br/>level almost three times the current fee (as in the case of  the I-129E and the I-<br/>485).  <br/><br/>In the case of the I-485, the Proposed Rules document states that &quot;interim <br/>benefits are added to this form type&quot;.  These benefits refer to obtaining a work <br/>permit until such time the I-485 visa is issued.  Currently this is a two-step <br/>process, which is optional.  The proposed change presumes that ALL I-485 <br/>applicants will want this benefit--which may or may not be the case.  <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e061", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:05:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T04:03:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Elizabeth Kramer", "trackingNbr": "8021e061", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2619/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2619/attachments"}}}}}
