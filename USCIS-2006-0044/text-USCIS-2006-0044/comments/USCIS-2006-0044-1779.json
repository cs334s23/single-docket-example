There are soooo <br/>many children who need good homes and the price isn&#39;t cheap.  I know my <br/>daughter will be worth every penny and I am very excited about this opportunity, <br/>but I am able to afford this process on my own.  I know there are good people out <br/>there who would be good parents and the price of adopting shouldn&#39;t stop them <br/>from having the opportunity to be parents.<br/><br/>Please think about this proposed increase and the impact on the many children.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a13b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:23:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T01:43:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kathy M.
