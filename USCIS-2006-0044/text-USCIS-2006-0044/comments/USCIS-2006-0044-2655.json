I have already had to <br/>pay twice for one adoption that hasn&#39;t been completed yet and wil probably have to pay a third time <br/>due to the tie ups in Guatemala.  I feel the fees are high enough along with the other fees that must <br/>be paid to adopt.  If you are going to make the fees higher, then make the expiration date last <br/>longer than 15 months for fingerprints and 18 months for approval.  Many adoptions are now taking <br/>longer than this time and therefore many people have to update both fees.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e409", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:37:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T17:06:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Terri Maestrole", "trackingNbr": "8021e409", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2655/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2655/attachments"}}}}}
