In my opinion,<br/>the illegal immigrant problem is so big there should be a DECREASE in fees. I<br/>think the government should actually eliminate fees for a period of time,<br/>perhaps 2 or 3 years, to encourage illegals to obtain citizenship legally.<br/>Surely we can afford to waive the fees for a few years.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa67d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T18:55:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-05T18:29:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kathleen R.
