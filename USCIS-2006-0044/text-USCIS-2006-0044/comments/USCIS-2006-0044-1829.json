As an adoptive family, the overall costs of adoption are <br/>staggering.  We and others want to bring more children into our families, but often <br/>the adoption costs prevent us from doing so.  Does raising the fees mean that the <br/>service from the USCIS offices will be faster?  Please strongly consider this <br/>request not to increase the filing fees.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Debra Bean<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a6ad", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T18:42:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T14:17:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "self", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Debra Bean", "trackingNbr": "8021a6ad", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1829/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1829/attachments"}}}}}
