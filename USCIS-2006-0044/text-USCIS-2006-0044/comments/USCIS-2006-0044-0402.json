Specifically, I am concerned<br/>about the increase in fees for forms I-600 and I-600A.  In October we received<br/>approval from UCIS to adopt a child from China.  We quickly submitted our<br/>application materials to China. However, the timeline between when we will<br/>receive a referral and be able to travel to China will likely extend further<br/>than the 18 month approval window for us. At this point in time, there is<br/>nothing that we can do to speed up the situation.  This will force us to file<br/>additional paperwork as well as pay the additional fees for filing of the form<br/>and being re-fingerprinted.<br/><br/>I can understand the rationale to increase fees....especially if it also<br/>delivers better service in a timely fashion. However, for some, I would ask that<br/>perhaps if the fee were to be increased that the length of validity of the form<br/>was also increased.  This will save time and  money not only for the customer<br/>but for the agency as well.    <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802069a1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T00:28:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T21:16:42Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By N.
