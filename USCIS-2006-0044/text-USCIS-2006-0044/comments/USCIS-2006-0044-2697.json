Some adoptions are now taking up to <br/>2 years requiring USCIS 171-H to be completed twice within the process.  <br/><br/>If rates cannot be kept at the lower levels, please implement rule exceptions for <br/>those of us who are adopting or raise the legitimacy time period from 15 months <br/>to at least 24 months.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in this matter.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>John Kemp<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e635", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:39:25Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T00:18:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by John Kemp", "trackingNbr": "8021e635", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2697/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2697/attachments"}}}}}
