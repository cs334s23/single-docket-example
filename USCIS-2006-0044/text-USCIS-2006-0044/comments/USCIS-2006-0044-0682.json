My wife and I <br/>have both already gone through the process of filing our I-600a and getting our <br/>finger prints.  We expected those costs as they were explanded to us by our <br/>adoption agency.  However, due to the lenght of time that it is taking to match <br/>with our daughter, we like many other adopting parents, will need to renew the I-<br/>600A and get new finger prints.  This additional cost was not something we had <br/>planned or budgeted for and while it will not stop us from adopting, it is a hardship.<br/><br/>Therefore, I ask that if you raise the cost for the initial filing of the I-600a and the <br/>finger prints, you lower the cost for the renewal.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020908c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:43:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T20:07:43Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Denny Rehberg", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by David W.
