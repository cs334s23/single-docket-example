We already pay a great fee for adopting beautiful children <br/>who NEED homes and loving families.  You have to pay the I-171H sometimes <br/>twice depending on how long the wait is, and now you want to increase the fees.  <br/>OUTRAGEOUS!!!  We are doing something good by giving the children loving <br/>homes we shouldn&#39;t have to break ourselves to do that.  Especially when people <br/>have babies EVERYDAY and then DON&quot;T go through half of what we do.  I think <br/>you need to leave the fees as there are or if you truly feel you need to change <br/>them you should lower them.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219f85", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:19:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T21:53:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80219f85", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1727/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1727/attachments"}}}}}
