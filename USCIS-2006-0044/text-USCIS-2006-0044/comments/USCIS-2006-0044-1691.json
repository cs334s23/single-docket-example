Adoption is a wonderful thing and has been pursued by <br/>many loving families, but the hardship that has already been taken on due to <br/>current regulations is sure to be made even more difficult (financially and <br/>emotionally) if the newly proposed regulations are put into action. Loving couples, <br/>many who have waited countless years to start a family (due to infertility, loss of a <br/>child, or other reasons) are having insult added to injury by the adoption <br/>process/timelines lengthening and becoming even more costly.  The current <br/>expiration timelines of documents cause many wonderful &quot;families to be&quot; to have <br/>to subject themselves to initial fees and then renewals of all of the required forms. <br/>With the adoption timelines lengthening for many countries, some to over 18 <br/>months, it is most certain that adoption families will be required to take time off of <br/>work, and reach into their wallets yet again to pay for adoption related petitions, <br/>so that they may finally reach their goals of finally becoming a family.<br/>Please do reconsider putting these regulations into affect as they are hurtful to <br/>those who are looking to adopt.<br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e50", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:13:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Deborah L.
