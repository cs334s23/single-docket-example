One pays for the <br/>administration time used, and not based on assumptions as the proposed rule will <br/>do. For example the elimination for interim benefits such as Advance Parole, <br/>EAD,... will be paid for by all individuals applying for I-485, even if they do not need <br/>to file for these interim benefits. As a result for some the price will jump from $325 <br/>to $905 which is a 300% increase instead of the 66% mentioned. Also, not <br/>everyone has to file for an entire family. Some are single. <br/><br/>Why not pay for what you need? <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021971f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-26T16:00:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-26T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-25T21:44:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021971f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1577/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1577/attachments"}}}}}
