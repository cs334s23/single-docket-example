Women are leaving having families later and later, and <br/>fertility problems are on the rise. These are inescapable facts that dictate a likely <br/>increase in the number of US citizens wanting to offer secure and happy homes to <br/>children from many nations. <br/>America leads the world in international adoption. My english wife would simply <br/>not have the option to adopt, as we are doing, from China. We are a model to <br/>other nations in this regard. <br/>When people adopt, often, they are at the end of a very difficult road. They may <br/>have suffered financially by paying for expensive medical treatments, or may have <br/>simply decided upon first diagnosis of fertility problems, to adopt a child who may <br/>not otherwise have had the chance of a secure and happy family. Whatever, their <br/>rationale, the people who decide to adopt internationally are committed people <br/>who are prepared to be judged, by the homestudy process, as good parents. <br/>Surely those who submit to this process with such commitment and <br/>determination are the people who should be most encouraged to raise sound, <br/>productive and happy citizens?<br/>Why, then, should they be penalised by further fees? <br/>I am writing to voice my extreme displeasure at the raising of the barrier, and <br/>fervently hope that the already heavy fees remain unchanged.<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>TA Hennard<br/>Secondary Principal, International School of Stavanger<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ee9a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:02:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T18:00:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tommie Hennard", "trackingNbr": "8021ee9a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2798/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2798/attachments"}}}}}
