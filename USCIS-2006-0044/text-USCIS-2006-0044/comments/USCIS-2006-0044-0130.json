Even worse, with the<br/>sky-rocketing fees, the applicants are suffering unbearably long waiting time<br/>and low quality work everyday. How is the proposed fee increase justified given<br/>the agency&#39;s history and current efficiency? <br/><br/>In the past and currently, many immigrant have expressed their willingness to<br/>accept such fee increase IF THE AGENCY IS GOING TO IMPROVE THEIR EFFICIENCY AND<br/>QUALITY OF ITS WORK. However, this has never being the case and does not seem to<br/>be the case in the future, given the agency&#39;s history of building tremendous<br/>backlog. I strongly OPPOSE the proposed fee increase.<br/><br/>Harry.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa1c7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T20:10:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T20:03:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801fa1c7", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0130/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0130/attachments"}}}}}
