Many families don&#39;t even begin <br/>the process of adoption for the sole reason of the cost.  I have heard countless <br/>families say they would love to adopt a child but they just can&#39;t afford it.  For many <br/>families, adoption is the only way they will be able to have children.  Due to this, I <br/>strongly urge you to reconsider raising the price of the U.S. Citizenship and <br/>Immigration process of adoption.  Many families who consider adoption are doing <br/>all they can to pay the high fees to adoption agencies, foreign governments, and <br/>travel.  Please don&#39;t let our government be another stumbling block to these <br/>parents waiting to bring their children home.  Please consider keeping the <br/>Immigration fees low.   <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ac79", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:18:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T02:30:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rachel L.
