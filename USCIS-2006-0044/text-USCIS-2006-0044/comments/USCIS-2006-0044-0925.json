We are in the process of completing <br/>an international adoption and are presently awaiting a referral.  Due to the long time-frame of the <br/>international adoption process (a 1.5 to 2 year wait for referral), and the limited term of the USCIS <br/>application, it ensures that many of those adopting internationally will have to apply/pay fee initially, <br/>and then do this again to renew as the year term approaches.  In the very least, if implementing a <br/>fee increase, then increasing the term of the application from 12 months to 2 years should be <br/>included.  This won&#39;t help me at this point, but would help the process by reducing meaningless <br/>government paperhandling involved for these renewals.  Thank you for your sincere consideration of <br/>this important matter.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020b50a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T14:56:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-24T15:41:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Robert B.
