But please wait until the end of 2007/early 2008 so that families that are <br/>adopting from China can completed adoptions that began in 2006. The costs of <br/>submitting for fingerprints &amp; immigration paperwork work two times due to the long <br/>wait from China is a burden for myself and other families. To raise the cost now <br/>will add additional financial difficulties to an already expensive and complicated <br/>process. Please allow us to adopt our daughter without adding on an additional <br/>expense. Raising fees at this time could really prevent an orphan from having a <br/>safe and loving home. Please do not raise the cost for families that are already in <br/>the process of adopting and who are renewing paperwork and fingerprints for the <br/>second time. We would like to achieve our goal of FAMILY. Thank you for your <br/>consideration regarding this matter.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207ab0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T17:13:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T18:49:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Theresa A.
