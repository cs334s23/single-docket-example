This fee hike will force immigrants who have various family members that <br/>simultaneously qualify for benefits not to be able to file together because these <br/>fees are so exorbitant.  Many immigrants are scammed by notarios and this fee <br/>hike will add to the financial loss they suffer when they discover they were ripped <br/>off by the notario, lost a lot of money in CIS fees, and possibly face deportation.  If <br/>CIS is fee based, how does it plan on surviving if filings significantly drop off <br/>because immigrants can&#39;t afford the fees ?  A reasonable fee hike is <br/>understandable but doubling or tripling the fees is unreasonable and severe and I <br/>hope you reconsider. Thank you. Elizabeth M. Mendoza Macias  P.S. One last <br/>thing, how about the U.S. government deduct $1,000 from the foreign aid we give a <br/>country for each national of theirs we deport ?  That money could be dedicated to <br/>CIS to process applications for immigrants here who don&#39;t engage in behavior that <br/>provokes their deportation.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f97e5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T19:15:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T18:08:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "N\\A", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Elizabeth M.
