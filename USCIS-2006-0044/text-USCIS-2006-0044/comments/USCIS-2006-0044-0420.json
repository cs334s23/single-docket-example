As a prospective adoptive parent, I am opposed to the fee <br/>increase. As I have already paid the fee once &amp; it has increased during the time I <br/>have waited for my referral, I feel this increase is undue. In addition, the Chinese <br/>government has slowed referrals drastically to the point most people will face <br/>expiration of their I171 before they receive a child. Thus most of us will have to pay <br/>the I600A fees &amp; fingerprint fees twice in the same adoption. If the I171 &amp; <br/>fingerprints had a longer expiration date, they might warrant increased fees. As <br/>yet, I have seen no change in service to justify any increase in fees especially <br/>since many USCIS offices take 3 months or longer to preocess the application.<br/>Cynthia Williams<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206be4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T01:17:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T00:34:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cynthia Williams", "trackingNbr": "80206be4", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0420/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0420/attachments"}}}}}
