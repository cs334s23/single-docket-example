Just to clarify, the fees are increasing for all the petitions at USCIS - not <br/>just for adoption. Keeping that in mind, we are recommending that the fees for <br/>adoption should be held because, for many of us, we have to file TWICE because <br/>the approval is only good for 18 months. With adoptions taking longer and longer, <br/>most of us have to file again as they do not permit us to renew our filing. They<br/>make us pay the full price again!<br/><br/>Here is what it costs to file with USCIS for a couple just to adopt:<br/><br/>What it used to be when adoptions took place within 18 months:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 or over 140%! That&#39;s how much more USCIS will<br/>make on just us, adopting parents, with no increase in services.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s not even taking into consideration the fact that applying for our<br/>children&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) goes from $215 to<br/>$460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase. Sometimes, we don&#39;t even<br/>get the certificates for a year after filing!<br/><br/>Please consider this proposal and take into consideration the young people who <br/>are waiting for about 2 years to get their little girls from China and then they have <br/>to reapply again and the extra cost is considerable.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021df47", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T00:27:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ann Thompson", "trackingNbr": "8021df47", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2600/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2600/attachments"}}}}}
