Now that the adoptions are taking well over 18 months <br/>from I-600A approval to completion, any further increase will be a further deterrent <br/>to people wanting to adopt, which would be a travesty.  There are already so many <br/>people in this country who would adopt if it weren&#39;t for financial barriers, and this <br/>rule would worsen the problem.  With the increasing number of deaths caused by <br/>poverty, AIDS, and other tragic causes, the number of orphans throughout the <br/>world is increasing exponentially every day.  I&#39;d like to think that the U.S. would be <br/>doing something to help bring these orphans into loving families, rather than <br/>discouraging adoption by increasing fees that already are very high, especially <br/>given the fact that most parents adopting internationally are forced to pay the fees <br/>twice.  At the very least, if the fees are increased, the rule should also extend the <br/>validity of the approval from 18 months to 2 years or more, to apply retroactively to <br/>adoptive parents already in the process.   Thank you for allowing me a chance to <br/>oppose this proposed rule, which likely will have tragic consequences if it is <br/>enacted.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f01c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T20:31:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Philip Darke", "trackingNbr": "8021f01c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2846/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2846/attachments"}}}}}
