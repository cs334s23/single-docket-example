USCIS <br/>adoption petitions last only 12 months.  I am incensed enough about paying twice <br/>(maybe even 3 times, who knows) for the same thing; I am certainly not interested <br/>in paying even higher fees for something for which I have already paid.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef54", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:12:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Timothy Moran", "trackingNbr": "8021ef54", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2816/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2816/attachments"}}}}}
