I am a person trying to adopt internationally and this fee increase is a <br/>financial strain to qualified applicants who are most likely going to have to re-apply and pay these <br/>fees a second time due to the 18 month expiration date. In addition to opposing this docket, I <br/>strongly urge for an extension to expiration date... 24 or more months!
