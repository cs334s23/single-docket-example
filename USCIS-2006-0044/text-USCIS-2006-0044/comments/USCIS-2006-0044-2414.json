My husband and I are in the process of adopting a girl from China.  <br/>We have already been approved by the USCIS and we are awaiting our referral <br/>from China.  We are already paying out over $20,000 in order to get our little girl.  <br/>We will more than likely have to apply for a second time with the USCIS before <br/>our daughter arrives due to the documents expiring.  Please help us by not adding <br/>more of a financial burden on our family.
