I was upset to hear this.  My husband and I are currently<br/>awaiting a referral from China.  Our paperwork will expire and I was<br/>disheartened to hear that we would have to pay even more money.  I really feel<br/>that it would be nice if the fee was not raised for those who are already in the<br/>process and just have to renew there paperwork.  Even better yet, it would be<br/>nice if there was a re-application/renewal fee that was different than the<br/>initial application fee.<br/><br/>I appreciate you taking the time to listen.<br/><br/>Thank you much!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020cace", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-01T21:23:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-01T14:44:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Melissa Jenkins", "trackingNbr": "8020cace", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0985/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0985/attachments"}}}}}
