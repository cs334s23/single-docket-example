As an adoptive parent, the expense involved with adopting internationally <br/>is already extremely high without this added hike in price.  There are many <br/>children around the world who deserve a home but parents are roadblocked by the <br/>costs involved in the process.  Now with the proposed fees going up as much as <br/>66% in some cases, more and more potential adoptive parents will be turned <br/>away because they will not be able to afford such high fees.<br/><br/>I am also asking you to specifically reconsider the expense of obtaining an <br/>adopted child&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship.  As an adoptive mother of a child from <br/>Korea, we are having to pay to obtain his Certificate of Citizenship.  This fee which <br/>is high to begin with at $255 is now proposed to be the outrageous expense of <br/>$460.  However, nothing additional is gained from such a steep increase in cost.  <br/>Also, it seems unjust that parents who adopt from Korea must pay for their child <br/>to receive a Certificate of Citizenship as opposed to parents adopting from <br/>countries such as Russia, China, the Ukraine, etc... whose children are GIVEN <br/>Certificates of Citizenship.  There should not be such an expensive discrepancy.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my comments, and I pray you will <br/>reconsider these fee increases.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Erin Parsons<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021efed", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T20:09:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Aaron Parsons", "trackingNbr": "8021efed", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2842/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2842/attachments"}}}}}
