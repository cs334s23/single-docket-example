The financial cost of adoption is <br/>already high but by increasing the cost of the Immigration application and <br/>biometric fees, this will only add to the financial impact to our family.  Plus due to <br/>our increased wait time for our daughter, we will have to re-file for our immigration <br/>application and fingerprints due to the limited time span it covers initially.  Please <br/>do not raise the fees.  Please do not burden those who are trying to enhance their <br/>family.
