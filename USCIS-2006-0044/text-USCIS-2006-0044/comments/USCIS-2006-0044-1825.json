We <br/>found the recent news of imigration fee increases troubling.  It&#39;s one thing to have <br/>a phased in rate increases, but an instant 66% increase is just unfair.<br/>    Many families are doing everything they can to raise the necessary funds to <br/>complete their adoptions.  Now we are expected to raise hundreds of additional <br/>dollars, money that could and should be spent for the welfare of our children.<br/>    We ask you to reconsider these rate increases or at the very least to phase <br/>these increases in over the next several years.  Our family can understand your <br/>current lack or resources, we&#39;re simply asking you to understand ours.  Do what <br/>is right by the American family. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a694", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T18:28:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T14:08:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Shawn T.
