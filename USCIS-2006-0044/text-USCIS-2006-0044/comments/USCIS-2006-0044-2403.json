This topic affects me, my husband, our <br/>families, and the future of our soon to be adopted child, as well as the future of <br/>countless children of all ages who need adopted.  Adoption has proven to be a <br/>difficult process administratively, emotionally, and financially.  During this <br/>process, I&#39;ve met many people wanting to be parents to love, protect, and educate <br/>children and are unable to do so because of the outrageous expense involved.  <br/>How many children are left behind in orphanages and inadequate foster homes all <br/>over the world because people who would be great parents cannnot afford to adopt <br/>them?  It also angers me to read this docket to learn that the fees are being <br/>raised to cover the costs of other immigrants who have made their own decisions <br/>to come to this country.  Like thousands of people, we are working hard to save <br/>the money for our child&#39;s adoption, and to raise them in this country.  Do not <br/>make it more difficult for the parents who want to do the same, and for the children <br/>who will have the opportunity to grow up as United States taxpaying citizens. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ce8b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:50:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T18:03:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Nanette Higgins", "trackingNbr": "8021ce8b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2403/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2403/attachments"}}}}}
