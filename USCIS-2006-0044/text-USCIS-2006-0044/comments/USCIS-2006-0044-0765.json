The increases are TOO DRASTIC.<br/>Some fees have more than doubled! I have never seen a business operate this way<br/>to support the cost of doing business. I think a re-evaluation needs to be done<br/>to accurately reflect a fair and reasonable solution which will benefit both<br/>parties. USCIS needs to realize that their proposed fee hikes are out of reach<br/>for many immigrants and also so sudden. If the fee increase needs to be that<br/>drastic, it should be rolled out quarterly or yearly.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a11e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:15:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T04:10:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Commented Submitted By Annoymous", "trackingNbr": "8020a11e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0765/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0765/attachments"}}}}}
