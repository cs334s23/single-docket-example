International adoption is about <br/>American families desiring to love and care for an orphan, to give them a family.  <br/>With a potential $460 increase in the current fees, which may have to be paid <br/>twice if the wait time is too long, could mean the difference of a loving home and <br/>family for a child or a foreign orphanage.  Adopting children into good homes in the <br/>United States is an investment in the future of our country.  We ask that you <br/>consider these issues and not raise fees.
