As a family who is quite Middle Class,<br/>the expense of having to re-do and re-submit our home study and application for<br/>a new I-171H was very difficult for us.  By raising your fees regularly without<br/>taking into consideration extended wait times for many countries from where<br/>families adopt, you are potentially limiting the dreams of many families and<br/>children.
