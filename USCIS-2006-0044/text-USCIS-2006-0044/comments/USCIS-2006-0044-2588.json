Because the I-171H expires after 18 months, I am already<br/>expecting to have to apply for the I-171H twice.  This fee increase would<br/>certainly cause additional financial burden, and I hope you consider my<br/>situation along with numerous others in the same situation that you not to<br/>increase the fees as you have proposed.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>John<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021deb1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T22:10:50Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by John", "trackingNbr": "8021deb1", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2588/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2588/attachments"}}}}}
