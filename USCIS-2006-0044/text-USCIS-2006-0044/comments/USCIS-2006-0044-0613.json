We are Claire and Keith Royer. We live in Steamboat Springs, CO and <br/>began the exciting and arduous process of adopting a child from China one year <br/>ago. After a five month paperchase, our dossier arrived in China 8/1/06. We now, <br/>along with many, many other families, are prepared for the long and hopeful wait to <br/>reach our child. We consider it a labor of love and will do whatever it takes to bring <br/>our child home. This is not an easy task. There are many obstacles still to <br/>overcome and we are prepared to meet them with enthusiam. This is where we <br/>need your help. Please help to alleviate the financial strains of this process by <br/>NOT increasing fees. It would be a tremendous help to all families working to bring <br/>their children home. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. We trust your <br/>decision will be in the best interest of these children and their families. <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Claire and Keith Royer<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802080d8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T18:25:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T04:09:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Claire E.
