Now we hear that we will need to update this <br/>information and pay these fees again which you are trying to raise the fees of up <br/>to  $670.00.  This  does not include the fees of updating our homestudy as well as <br/>fingerprinting etc.too.<br/>Please reconsider these charges for us Americans  that are looking to expand our <br/>families through adoption!!<br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208052", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T21:07:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T02:58:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By MaryAnn DeAlto", "trackingNbr": "80208052", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0553/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0553/attachments"}}}}}
