International adoption is a very complicated, emotional, <br/>and expensive process.   There are millions of orphans world-wide in desperate <br/>need of homes.  We must, therefore, make it as affordable and convenient as <br/>possible to families that desire to bring these precious ones home.  I understand <br/>fully the need to adjust for cost increases.  Is there some way to make the <br/>adoption process exempt from the fee increases?   Discouraging adoption is a <br/>very important and critical potential negative impact of these fee changes that <br/>should be carefully weighed and considered.  Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Lori J.
