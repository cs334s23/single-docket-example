Given the extended adoption timeframe we are experiencing <br/>with the Chinese government, most of us will have to apply for a second set of <br/>fingerprints and submit a second I-600 before we&#39;re able to travel to China to <br/>complete our adoption as our originals will expire. International adoption is an <br/>expensive endeavor; please don&#39;t add more expense than we already have in this <br/>process.<br/><br/>I greatly appreciate the time you took to read this note - and hope you&#39;ll take a few <br/>more minutes to think about the financial implications this will have for so many <br/>families who are trying to do a good thing.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Diane and Martin Janowak<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208060", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T18:25:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T03:19:59Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Congressman Dennis Moore", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Diane S.
