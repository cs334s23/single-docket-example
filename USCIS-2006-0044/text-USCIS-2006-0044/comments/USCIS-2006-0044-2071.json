We have adopted 5 times from<br/>Eastern Europe and the costs are already overwhelming.  We have paid so many<br/>I600 fees, visa fees, fingerprint fees etc. (and WHY do fingerprints expire<br/>anyway?)  <br/><br/>We have a daughter who entered the country after the automatic citizenship law<br/>went into effect but before the certificates of citizenship became automatic. <br/>(July 2003).  Beginning in about January 2004, certificates started being sent<br/>automatically about 6 weeks after the child entered the US on an IR3 visa (as<br/>our daughter did).  We were told by BCIS that the certificates for adoptions<br/>during 2003 would be &quot;caught up&quot; the certificates would come about a year later.<br/> Of course, it has not come for over 3 years.  She will be 18 this year and we<br/>are going to have to pay a fee for a certificate that we were promised would<br/>come automatically!!!!!  That fee is now $255 and is proposed to go up to $460.<br/> We already paid for her IR3 Visa, and she IS a citizen!  Children we adopted in<br/>2005 got their certificate automatically, but our other daughter did not..  <br/><br/>So, a system that is not doing what it is supposed to be doing is now going to<br/>start charging more to NOT do it?
