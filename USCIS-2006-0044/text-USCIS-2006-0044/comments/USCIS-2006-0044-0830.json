As you know, these processes are key components in families&#39; <br/>efforts to adopt children from overseas.  The expense involved in state, federal, <br/>and country specific paperwork already stretches the abilities of many families.  <br/>With the length of time that many of us must wait before our paperwork is <br/>approved by the foreign government, our 171s and fingerprint approvals are <br/>expiring before we can travel to adopt our children.  This means that we have to go <br/>through the entire application process again and that any fee increase will hit <br/>families twice as hard.<br/><br/>My hope is that these fee increases can be avoided and that funding can be <br/>generated from other sources.  Ideally sources that do not involve efforts to provide <br/>loving homes for children in need.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a7fb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-23T18:56:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-23T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-22T14:42:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By CLM Manyin", "trackingNbr": "8020a7fb", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0830/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0830/attachments"}}}}}
