We are in <br/>the process of adoption internationally from China, not only do your documents <br/>expire, which I believe the time frames on those should be changed as we are no <br/>longer able to complete and adoption in that time frame, but now it could cost us <br/>several thousand dollars more not once but twice.  Please reconsider your fee <br/>increases and the amount of time for them to expire.  Adoption is costly enough <br/>without our own government adding to it.
