If the proposed rule is adopted, filing fees would increase by an <br/>average of 66% over current fees.  This proposed raising of fees will cause an <br/>approximately $500 increase PER FAMILY working towards adopting an orphan <br/>born internationally.<br/><br/>There are millions of orphans worldwide and thousands of American families who <br/>are ready and willing to give these children a loving home.  All too often, it is <br/>financial barriers that keep these ophaned children from finding a loving family in <br/>the United States.  My husband and I recently adopted a beautiful 9 month old <br/>Vietnamese girl with special needs.  We chose to work through a highly <br/>respected and ethical adoption agency and our adoption fees totalled over <br/>$20,000.  The proposed fee increase will only make this financial obstacle to <br/>adoption even larger, potentially keeping more orphans from finding loving families.<br/><br/>Please DO NOT accept these proposed fee increases!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021eda3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T16:21:59Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Stacy", "trackingNbr": "8021eda3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2777/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2777/attachments"}}}}}
