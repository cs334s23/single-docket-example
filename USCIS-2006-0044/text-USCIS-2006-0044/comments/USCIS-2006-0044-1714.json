International adoptions already cost more than $15,000 and these potential increases <br/>will continue to place unfair and unnecessary burdens on loving families eager to adopt <br/>internationally. The justification for increasing fees to improve efficiency and account for <br/>homeland security issues is flawed, as is the reason that fees have not been increased in a <br/>while. A brief review of the fee history shows that fees for the I-600 alone have increased by 250 <br/>percent since 1994, and the proposed increase will push that over 300 percent. The N-600 <br/>increases have been as bad, and the proposal will place the increase at more than 350 percent <br/>since 1994. Increasing fees as a claim to improve efficiency does not sit well with either me or <br/>my wife, given that CIS lost paperwork associated with our I-600 application this past year, <br/>prolonging what is supposed to be a three-month process into twice that. Whatever problems <br/>exist in processing paperwork cannot be solved by simply passing the cost along to the <br/>applicant. And requiring adopting families to undergo even more background checks, etc., in the <br/>name of homeland security makes no sense. I recognize that the nation must protect its citizens <br/>and borders from the threat of terrorism, but someone please explain to me what threat to <br/>national security is posed by adopting families and the orphaned children, usually less than a <br/>year old?<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219f39", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:53:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T21:10:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Lance W.
