I-600/600A, Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative<br/>2. N-565, Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship <br/>3. N-600, Application for Certificate of Citizenship<br/>4. Biometric Services <br/> <br/>As you know, the above petitions and services are required for U.S. citizens <br/>adopting foreign-born children and bringing them home to the United States.  Like <br/>myself, these are often citizens who have already undergone tremendous financial <br/>and emotional strain to bring a child into their lives, and the proposed fee <br/>increases -- at an average of 66% -- only put the dream of parenthood that much <br/>further out of reach for Americans of low and middle incomes.  These citizens go <br/>to great lengths to secure the extensive funding necessary for adoption, and every <br/>increase in costs pushes adoption, and thus parenthood, beyond the realm of <br/>possibility for more families.  <br/> <br/>Please do not increase fees for the above listed petitions and services, which <br/>would be to the detriment of hopeful, would-be parents like myself. Thank you very <br/>much for your consideration.<br/><br/>Deborah K.
