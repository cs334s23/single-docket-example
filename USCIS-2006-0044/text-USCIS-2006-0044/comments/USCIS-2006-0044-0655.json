Such a considerable increase will effectively turn <br/>away so many of those who come to this country to build a better future for <br/>themselves and their families.  <br/><br/>I understand the desire to process applications expeditiously, but if people are <br/>turned away by the cost, what good will it do to be able to process the remaining <br/>applications more quickly?  The goal of immigration services should be to help the <br/>most people, not help people the quickest.
