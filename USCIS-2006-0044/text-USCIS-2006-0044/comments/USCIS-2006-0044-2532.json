Many of us in the <br/>adoptive community are required to re-apply for either approval or fingerprinting as <br/>the wait for many international adoptions is taking longer and longer.  Thus, we <br/>are basically charged twice for something that is beyond our control.  If we could <br/>control the length of time it takes for the adoption, we certainly wouldn&#39;t prolong it <br/>and let our paperwork expire.  Many of us are already struggling to pay the fees <br/>required to fulfill our American Dream of a family, and the proposed increases will <br/>unfortunately eliminate many families from being able to accomplish this goal.  <br/>The wait is difficult enough, now we would also have the burden of outrageous fee <br/>increases.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dc6e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:20:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T15:32:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent, Cynthia Croker", "trackingNbr": "8021dc6e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2532/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2532/attachments"}}}}}
