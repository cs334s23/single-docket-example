If the proposed rule is adopted,<br/>filing fees would increase by an average of 66% over current fees.<br/><br/>We are just beginning to start the adoption process.  Do you realize it is <br/>anywhere from $20,000-$35,000 CASH UPFRONT to adopt a child?  We are <br/>already struggling to come up with that kind of cash.  Increasing it would only <br/>hurt  and hinder those couples and single parents who wish to give a poor, <br/>unwanted child a loving home.  Adoption is expensive enough already, and it is <br/>unconscionable to raise fees by up to 66% for adoption-related petitions.<br/><br/>PLEASE DON&#39;T DO THIS!  Ultimately you will be affecting hundreds and <br/>thousands of children if you make it even more difficult for adoptive parents to <br/>adopt.  <br/><br/>Please have a heart and DON&#39;T pass this proposal.  <br/>Thank you, <br/>Mr. &amp; Mrs. John &amp; Tina Cowsert<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f015", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T20:26:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tina Cowsert", "trackingNbr": "8021f015", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2845/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2845/attachments"}}}}}
