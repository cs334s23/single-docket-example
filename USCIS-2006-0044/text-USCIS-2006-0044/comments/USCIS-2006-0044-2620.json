The fees are already high and with <br/>the short time frames in which approvals are valid (18 months for I-600A and 15 <br/>months for fingerprints), many families have to file twice to complete a single <br/>adoption.  <br/><br/>Here is what it costs to file with USCIS for a couple just to adopt:<br/><br/>What it used to be when adoptions took place within 18 months:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 or over 140%! <br/><br/>On top of those fees, once the child is home, the cost of a Certificate of <br/>Citizenship is already high at $215 and is slated to increase to $460, a difference <br/>of $245 or about 120% increase. <br/><br/>These fee increases will affect thousands of people who are already hemorrhaging <br/>cash to pay for an adoption, some after years of infertility treatments.
