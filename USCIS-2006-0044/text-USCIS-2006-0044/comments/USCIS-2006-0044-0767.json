We are very <br/>disappointed to hear that there is a possibility that the fees for the biometrics and I-<br/>600A may be increasing.  With the current wait for a referral from China, not only <br/>will be have to pay these fees once, but since they will expire prior to our referral &amp; <br/>travel, we will need to pay the fees twice.  It is very costly to adopt internationally <br/>and in order to encourage families to adopt, not increasing the fees would help <br/>greatly.<br/><br/>I ask you to reconsider not only the fee increase, but also the expiration time for <br/>these documents.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Lisa DeVries<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a12d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:15:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T04:59:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa A.
