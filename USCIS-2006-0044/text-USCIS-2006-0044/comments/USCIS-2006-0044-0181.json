I saved for 2 years to be able to pay for <br/>my citizenship because it is very hard to save 400 dollars in a low income family. <br/>You need to consider that people asking for adjustmen is not rich and high <br/>edudated people, our salaries can&#39;t compete with weel educated proffessionals, <br/>and we go and work very hard everyday, mostly in occupations that are bad paid. <br/>Not becouse we liked them but becouse we dont hae other choice, so we <br/>sacrifize and keep studing. One of the most wonderful benefits to be a citizen is <br/>the possibility of going to th university and get loans. now you want to make our <br/>possibilities eveb harder to reach. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801faa13", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-06T14:42:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-06T01:04:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Zulema D.
