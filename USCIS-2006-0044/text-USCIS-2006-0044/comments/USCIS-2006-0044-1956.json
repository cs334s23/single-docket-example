My wife and I are United <br/>States citizens - multi generational Floridians, born and raised in Florida.  <br/>Because of the cumbersome and daunting adoption rules in the USA, we decided to <br/>adopt internationally, through China.  China has a wonderful adoption program <br/>that looks favorably upon foreign adoptions.  Unfortunately, the entire process <br/>takes a VERY long time and the USCIS I-171H form has an expiration date that <br/>renders the form useless BEFORE the adoption can take place.  This means we have <br/>to get fingerprinted again and get another I-171H before we travel.  So, not <br/>only do we have to pay these very high fees once, we have to pay them TWICE <br/>because the form and the fingerprints usually expire before families can travel <br/>to China to get their babies.<br/><br/>The price of adoption is high enough already.  We are not rich.  We are working <br/>class US Citizens who are working very hard and saving every dime we make to<br/>have enough money to have a family.  Please do not raise <br/>these rates that are already too high.<br/><br/>A possible solution to raising the rates would be to extend the life of the <br/>I-171H document.  If the life of the document was longer, USCIS workers would <br/>not have to process as many documents (it would cut their workload in half for <br/>each family that was adopting from China).<br/><br/>Please reconsider this terrible increase.  Thank you for allowing me to comment.  <br/>Please feel free to contact me to discuss this further.  <br/><br/>David Monroe<br/>Key West, FL.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021abe2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:08:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T01:15:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ronald D.
