Since the biometrics (fingerprints) is <br/>only valid for 12 months and the I-171H is only valid for 18 months, this means that <br/>families must renew their fingerprints and their I-171H at least once and in more <br/>and more cases twice. With the cost of an adoption from China hovering at <br/>$20,000 any additional fees become an undo burden on these families.  If you <br/>decide that an increase is absolutely necessary and there are no other options, <br/>please consider increasing the fingerprint and I-171H validity to 24 months and/or <br/>increasing the adoption tax credit to offset the cost of the corresponding fee <br/>increase. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a0e5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:04:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T00:50:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tina Powis-Dow", "trackingNbr": "8021a0e5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1769/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1769/attachments"}}}}}
