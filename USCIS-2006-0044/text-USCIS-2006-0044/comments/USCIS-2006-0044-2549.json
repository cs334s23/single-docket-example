This <br/>increase seems exorbitant in light of past fee increases.  These forms and <br/>services affect people who are in the process or adopting children from other <br/>countries.  <br/><br/>I compared the processing time of the I-600A/I-600 (3.39 months) to a form that <br/>has a similar processing time, the I-140 (3.31 months).  Despite similar <br/>processing times, the I-140 has a much higher work volume (140,158 for the I-140 <br/>vs. 29,500 for the I-600/I-600A).  However, the I-140 has a current fee of $195 <br/>compared to the I-600/I-600A&#39;s current fee of $545.  In 1998, the I-600/I-600A&#39;s <br/>fees increased by about 150% while the I-140 did not have any significant <br/>increase up until this time, where the proposed increased amount is $475.  <br/><br/>Considering these figures, it seems unfair to again impose an increase of fees on <br/>people who are already in a very costly process to adopt a child.  <br/><br/>One way you could save money in the fingerprinting area is to change the process <br/>so that adoptive parents do not have to repeatedly go in for fingerprinting each <br/>time their fingerprints &quot;expire&quot;.  It seems you could save a lot of money by only <br/>fingerprinting prospective adoptive parents one time, then simply running their <br/>already completed prints through the system when the time period expires to <br/>make sure they hadn&#39;t committed any crimes in the meantime.  <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to express my concerns.  <br/><br/>Lisa Wieskamp<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dd2c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T17:58:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T17:27:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Leonard Boswell", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa Wieskamp", "trackingNbr": "8021dd2c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2549/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2549/attachments"}}}}}
