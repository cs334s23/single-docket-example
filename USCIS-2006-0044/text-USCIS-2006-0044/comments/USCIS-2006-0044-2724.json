Specifically, I am opposed <br/>to all fee increses which increase the cost of international adoption.  My wife and I <br/>completed our I-600A in December of 2005 and are currently beginning the <br/>process again due to the lengthy process in China as well as unlrealistic <br/>expiration dates on the part of the US government.  <br/><br/>This increase unfairly targets families who are already bearing an expensive <br/>burnden and will discourage further adoptions.  At a time of automation, <br/>computerization and communication, it is hard to believe the costs of tracking <br/>information in databases and filing paperwork is getting more expensive.  This <br/>becomes nothing more than a tax on those attempting to complete their families.  <br/><br/>It is fine for those receiving services to bear the burden of supporting the service, <br/>however, this fee increase is neither warrented nor should be placed upon those <br/>already burdened with many other expenses.  66% increase in governement fees <br/>for adoption is unjust and should not be approved.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e772", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T04:19:43Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Charles Hagele", "trackingNbr": "8021e772", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2724/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2724/attachments"}}}}}
