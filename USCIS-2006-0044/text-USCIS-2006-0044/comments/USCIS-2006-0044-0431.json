Many international adoption programs are taking <br/>longer than 18 months to complete the adoption. Because of this families have to pay the fee 2 <br/>times, so the actual cost is $990+280.  Before raising fees please take a closer look at this and <br/>also ask what are we paying for as a US citizen that can substaniate this fee, it already seems <br/>high.
