We just brought home 2 children from Ethiopia and are <br/>considering international adoption in the future.  Adoption is expensive enough as <br/>it is, without paying more for a service that isn&#39;t all that streamlined to begin with.<br/><br/>Our experience in Customs &amp; Immigration in Dulles International Airport was a <br/>nightmare!  The staff were rude, the whole process was disorganized.  We had an <br/>approx. 4 hour layover and because of our wait in &quot;secondary&quot;, we were minutes <br/>away from missing our flight.  People were processed in no particular order.  <br/>People who entered last were processed before many others.  Even after the <br/>supervisor called for all IR3s &amp; IR4s to be processed, the employees were still <br/>processsing single individuals.  I would be absolutely livid about having to pay <br/>even more next time around for this poor service.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021df54", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T00:37:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Angela Roller", "trackingNbr": "8021df54", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2602/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2602/attachments"}}}}}
