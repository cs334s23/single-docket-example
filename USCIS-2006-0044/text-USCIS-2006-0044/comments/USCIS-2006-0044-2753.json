The fees charged by USCIS are already among <br/>the highest charged for any USCIS service.  In addition, the fees have increased <br/>exponentially over the past 10 years.  It appears as if USCIS views adopting <br/>families as an open check book willing and able to subsidize the other services of <br/>USCIS.  I hope that USCIS will reconsider this proposed fee increase.
