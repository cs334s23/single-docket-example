The effort in preparing <br/>paperwork and the expense of adoption will have a great reward in the end.  <br/>However, with word of the proposal to raise the cost associated with the <br/>fingerprinting and I71-H, we are afraid that many will not pursue adoption.  We are <br/>afraid that the extra expense will cost much more that mere dollars.  Perhaps it <br/>will cost a child a new beginning in a loving home.  A family may have a large <br/>heart, but not a large purse.  Adoption is a rewarding, yet expensive journey.  <br/>Please do not make the adoption process any harder than it already is, especially <br/>now that waiting periods have been expanded.  Many families, including our own, <br/>will probably have to undergo the fingerprinting and I71-H process again.  This will <br/>mean another fee of around $600 on top of the fees already incurred.  Raising the <br/>fees may put excessive burdens on families so that they simply may not be able <br/>to adopt.  Please keep the children first and reconsider the raising of these fees.<br/><br/>Thank you in behalf of all orphaned and abandoned children everywhere.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802145fd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-16T18:29:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-16T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-16T02:10:58Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Daphyne R.
