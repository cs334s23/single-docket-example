I am <br/>an adoptive parent who has no choice but to file this paperwork even though my daughter is <br/>legally a U.S. citizen, having been adopted from China in late 2001.  Parents adopting in <br/>recent years receive the Certificate of Citizenship automatically a few weeks after they <br/>return home.  However, parents in my position must file the N-600, wait months for an <br/>appointment to drive many hours for an interview, and pay a very steep fee.  I sincerely <br/>hope this increase will be reconsidered.<br/><br/>Juliana M.
