We have already<br/>been out more than it should take to adopt a child.  The china adoptions have<br/>now been extended and we have to again redo the process.  This is costly plus<br/>now you have decided to raise it more.  Our budgets are really tight.  <br/><br/>This is also a disservice to the ones who want to adopt behind me.  THey also<br/>will have to pay the larger amounts.  If there is one rule I would like to see<br/>is to extend the length of the  document. <br/><br/>Please reconsider 66% is too much<br/>Thanks for listening<br/>Hank Bowles<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f1e1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:08:25Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-03T01:02:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "none", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Henry Bowles", "trackingNbr": "8021f1e1", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2875/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2875/attachments"}}}}}
