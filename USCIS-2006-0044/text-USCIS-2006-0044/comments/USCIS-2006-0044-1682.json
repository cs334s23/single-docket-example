The costs for such an <br/>endeavor are already extremely high and additional costs added by our own <br/>country are unecessary.  As it is, it amounts to over $1000 in USCIS fees for the <br/>average family between the I600 A and fingerprints for two ($665) and the I-600 <br/>($380).  I really think that is already a substantial amount to pay.  In addition, <br/>those of us needing the Certificate of Citizenship get to pay for one if only one <br/>spouse travels, while they are issued automatically (for FREE) to families with <br/>both parents travelling.  I think given that some of us are having to pay for <br/>documents that are given to others for free, the cost for the document  is already <br/>high enough. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e27", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:00:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Dawn W", "trackingNbr": "80219e27", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1682/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1682/attachments"}}}}}
