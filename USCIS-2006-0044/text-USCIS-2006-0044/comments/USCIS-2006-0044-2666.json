Three of my children are <br/>international adoptees.  They entered this country with IR-3 Visas and, under U.S. <br/>law, became U.S. citizens upon entrance into the U.S.  BUT because USCIS only <br/>sent them green cards because they did not have a process in place at that time <br/>to automatically issue adoptees their certificates of citizenship, we have to submit <br/>an application for citizenship just as though they were not citizens at all.  The <br/>process has been changed since we brought our children home but USCIS has <br/>not found a way to issue my children their certificates of citizenship without us <br/>filing the same application as non-citizen applicants and also paying the same fee <br/>as non-citizen applicants.  That alone is unfair and outrageous.  So while this <br/>required process is outrageous since my children are already U.S. citizens, it is <br/>even more outrageous that now USCIS intends to substantially increase the <br/>application fees.  Instead of costing my family $765 to obtain the 3 certificates of <br/>citizenship under the proposed fee increases it will cost my family $1,388.  Do you <br/>really think this is fair?  I certainly don&#39;t nor do all the adoptive families who are in <br/>the same situation we are in.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e46e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:37:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T18:26:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Senator Lautenberg", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Martha Reading", "trackingNbr": "8021e46e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2666/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2666/attachments"}}}}}
