Most families go into adoption trying to <br/>make a small difference in the world. The red tape that these families have to go <br/>through because of all governments is almost insurmountable but we forge on to <br/>make sure a little one in a far away land has the opportunity for the best life <br/>possible. We all understand that it cost money to adopt, but let&#39;s be realistic here, <br/>raising your prices 66% is a lot of money. We are ripped off in gas, taxes, and <br/>other items in the USA, help us stay a little ahead when it comes to our families.<br/><br/>Your customer services should be the item that you concentrate on, customer <br/>service is lousy in some states. We waited a long time just to receive a one page <br/>report saying we could adopt, and have not committed any gastly crimes. Then <br/>when we finally get the report, it expires in 18 months, our finger prints expire in 15 <br/>months, which in most countries right now is not enough time to adopt a child. <br/>Why are you not addressing this portion of the problem, like most of us parents <br/>have ask for, instead of raising prices on yet another governmental item. Not only <br/>did we pay a high price for the privelege of getting our fingerprints done, reviewed <br/>and a report issued, we could not get a hold of anyone to find out where they were <br/>in the process, they have no number to reach anyone at in that governmental office <br/>and when I did get someone on the line, they yelled at me for 2 minutes for asking <br/>a question. VERY POOR, you are our government, should be serving the people, <br/>not the other way around.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a882", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:53:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:24:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Adopted Parents", "trackingNbr": "8021a882", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1843/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1843/attachments"}}}}}
