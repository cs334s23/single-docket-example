I would ask you to re-consider raising the fees in <br/>these programs. The cost of adoption, domestic as well as international, which <br/>these fees would impact, is high.  Raising these fees only adds to the financial <br/>burden of a family trying to bring a child home.  If it is absolutely necessary to <br/>raise the fees, please consider, a slight increase, not the proposed rate.  It is a <br/>great burden to people trying to give a child a home and family.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ac65", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T12:45:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T02:19:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021ac65", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1985/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1985/attachments"}}}}}
