The US CIS is proposing a 66% <br/>increase in fees for I-600 form applications, biometrics, and other paperwork.  My <br/>husband and I have been working on adopting a child from China for over a year.  <br/>International adoption is already an extraordinarily expensive process. A sixty-six <br/>percent increase in fees from the CIS adds to an already huge burden on people <br/>who are simply trying to become parents in one of the only ways open to them.  <br/>Please reconsider this increase.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219fe9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:20:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T22:33:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Christine A.
