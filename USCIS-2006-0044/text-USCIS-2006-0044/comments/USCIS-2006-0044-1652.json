How could our <br/>government suggest to raise adoption costs?  How could our government raise <br/>costs that would eliminate the possiblity for people to adopt?  The costs are <br/>already to high.  Now, by adding additional costs, we are creating a situation <br/>where children will suffer because these children will not be adopted due to the <br/>high costs.  <br/><br/>It has been my American dream to become a parent.  I am a school teacher.  My <br/>finances are adequate to raise a child.  I possess the skills, love, and desire to <br/>become an outstanding parent.  When the adoption costs increase, I would not be <br/>able to affort the adoption process.  How can our government deny my dream by <br/>raising the cost of adoption?  How can our government deny qualified perspective <br/>parents the right to adopt?  The price increase will negatively impact <br/>AMERICANS!  Stop the price increase!   In fact, help provide additional monetary <br/>support so that more qualified individuals can adopt in order to provide outstanding <br/>homes to children who would not have an opportunity to grow, love, and succeed <br/>in the world!  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219d07", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T14:30:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T17:57:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "World's Together", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Ed M.
