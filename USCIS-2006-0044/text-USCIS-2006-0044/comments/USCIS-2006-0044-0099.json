Those who appy should pay a <br/>sufficient amount to off set the administrative services needed to do so.  I feel the <br/>increase is needed and American Taxpayers should not pay for these services.<br/>Our country is becoming over populated as it is and I feel we need a moratorium in <br/>the amount of immigrants granted in coming to this country.  I feel most come to <br/>use our country.  They want everything for free; but our country gives back so <br/>much and those wanting to come here to live must pay to do so.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9b03", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2008-04-03T17:52:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T05:05:42Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Colette (Surname Unknown)", "trackingNbr": "801f9b03", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0099/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0099/attachments"}}}}}
