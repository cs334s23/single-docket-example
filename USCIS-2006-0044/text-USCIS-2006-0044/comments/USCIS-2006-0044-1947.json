For example, the cost for an I-485 (register for <br/>permanent status) is currently $325 and would increase to $905, or a 178 percent increase.  I can <br/>hardly think of any other good or service that would increase 178 percent in price year over year.  I <br/>suggest limiting increases to 25 percent of current levels and applying the increases gradually over <br/>the next five years.  Furthermore, the fees should be kept at a reasonable level, in order to <br/>encourage legal immigration and discourage illegal immigration.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab97", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T13:56:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T00:18:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sam Savant", "trackingNbr": "8021ab97", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1947/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1947/attachments"}}}}}
