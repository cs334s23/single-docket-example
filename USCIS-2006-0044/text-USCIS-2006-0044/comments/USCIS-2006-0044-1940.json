The fee increases specifically for N-600 (which may<br/>have to be applied for / paid for twice with the waiting times required in<br/>international adoptions) and N-565 are especially harsh. For the N-600, if a<br/>family has to apply twice, for one adoption, due to the waiting times as is<br/>common, that is $920 alone!   We are currently in the process of an<br/>international adoption and the fees related to this are already exhorbitant. <br/><br/>Perhaps making international adoption related petitions exempt from the fee<br/>increases, as proposed for those with T nonimmigrant status, would be a more<br/>acceptable compromise.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab62", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T13:55:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T23:48:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sarah Gimbel", "trackingNbr": "8021ab62", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1940/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1940/attachments"}}}}}
