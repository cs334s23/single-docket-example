International adoption is already too<br/>expensive for most<br/>people, and this will make it even worse. Increasing these fees is wrong,<br/>because people will pay anything to adopt, they&#39;ll take out loans, leverage<br/>their house, anything... this is really a very underhanded way of getting more<br/>money from us taxpayers!!! What I&#39;m saying is that people have no alternative to<br/>paying these fees - you really have really desperate people and you&#39;re making<br/>their right to have a family even more of a hardship. Why don&#39;t you find another<br/>source of money??? Like cutting some other wasteful program. This fee increase<br/>is very disappointing and really shows the evil side of government.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ee92", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T17:57:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Theresa", "trackingNbr": "8021ee92", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2796/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2796/attachments"}}}}}
