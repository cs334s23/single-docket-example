So, the once total cost of $685 <br/>doubles to $1370 if the fees remain the same. If the fees increase this could jump <br/>to $1660. This is a very large increase. How will the services reflect the increase? <br/>Because waiting for the results of the fingerprinting and the I600A approval took <br/>the longest during the compilation of the dossier. From time of application to <br/>approval was over 2 months. This is a long time when considering a child is <br/>waiting for a family and a family anxious to get their child. It would be a great <br/>disservice to many waiting children and their future families to increase fees <br/>without enhancing the service. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e029", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:05:25Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T03:24:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kelly Bockelmann", "trackingNbr": "8021e029", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2617/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2617/attachments"}}}}}
