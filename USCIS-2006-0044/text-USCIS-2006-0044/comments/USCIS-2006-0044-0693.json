So now, these <br/>families are incurring double the costs + higher fees!  It is like being double-taxed!  <br/>Until the USCIS extends the expiration dates of fingerprints and the I171-H <br/>document, raising the fees is unfair and puts an even larger burden on families <br/>going through an already extremely cumbersome process.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jenny Lagerquist<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020925b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:44:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T23:38:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jenny M.
