The increased fees can be tolerated if the service <br/>times for processing are decreased and length of time on the approval can be <br/>increased.  The time adpotive parents spend waiting for the I600/I600-A to be <br/>approved can be months.  This is reflected in USCIS documentation that the <br/>average processing time is 3.83 months.  This is almost 4 months added to the <br/>already agonizing wait times associated with international adoption.  The approved <br/>paperwork is only valid for 18 months.  In many cases this length of time is not <br/>sufficient for the family to complete the adoption.  In many cases the families are <br/>then put back into the position of re-filing the I600/I600-A and once again paying <br/>the fees and once again waiting for approval.  As an adoptive mother I speak from <br/>the heart and the wallet when I say this needs to be addressed.  If fees must be <br/>raised please also consider extending the length of time that the approval is valid <br/>to 24 months.  This would ease the mental and financial burden of the family and <br/>reduce the need for USCIS to process a family multiple times.<br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Lisa Shulin<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b618", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:16:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T19:11:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa P.
