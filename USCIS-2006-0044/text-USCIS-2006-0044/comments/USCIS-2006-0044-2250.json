As I <br/>am sure you are aware, this process is very costly.  Between the money that we <br/>pay in the U.S. and the money we pay in China, it is very expensive.  While it is <br/>most definitely worth the money for the children we adopt into our families, any <br/>additional costs make it hard to manage financially.  We would like to be able to <br/>take this money and use it for the necessities involved in taking care of these <br/>precious children.  Please understand that we want to provide only the best for our <br/>new addition to our family and this additional cost takes away from that and <br/>creates more of a burden financially.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c5e5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:57:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T00:34:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Carla Alexander", "trackingNbr": "8021c5e5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2250/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2250/attachments"}}}}}
