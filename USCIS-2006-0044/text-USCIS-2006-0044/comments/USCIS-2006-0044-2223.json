Such a fee increase both<br/>prohibits average citizens from adopting out of country while promising no<br/>guaranteed benefit to said citizens.<br/><br/>The argument to increase fees noted in the Federal Register is to &quot;increase service<br/>delivery&quot; but the propsal offers no specific or measurable goals or action plan. The<br/>decentralized nature of state offices currently means that clients of CIS, such<br/>as myself, are subjected to state, local, or regional procedural idiosyncracies,<br/>uncertain delays and processing time, and a host of variables that seem<br/>controlled often by the whim of a specific individual or office. Perhaps<br/>specific benchmarks for specific and useful procedures with expected timelines<br/>would justify such an increase, especially if there was the possibility of a<br/>wholesale revamping of procedures. But such mention of clear and transparent action<br/>steps is not visible in the proposal. Thus, increasing fees without accountability<br/>would be a shameful and disappointing move by the government. Such increases<br/>would not benefit citizens of this country and would do more harm than good. <br/><br/>Increasing fees by 66% without any *guarantee* for increased service delivery is<br/>unacceptable. <br/><br/>I do not support this regulation and urge my fellow Americans and policy makers<br/>to reject this proposal in its entirety.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c1ab", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:45:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T17:23:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sharon Lawrence", "trackingNbr": "8021c1ab", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2223/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2223/attachments"}}}}}
