Today the exact same form <br/>costs a prospective adoptive parent $545. Biometric fingerprinting, which began in <br/>1998, has risen in cost from $25 to $70 per applicant. For a two-parent family <br/>adopting a single child, the USCIS process costs an upward of $685. For single <br/>parents, this burden may mean even more.  Because of the instability concurrent <br/>with international adoption, many families find that their USCIS approval expires <br/>prior to their invitation to travel to their prospective child&#39;s birth country. As a <br/>result, many families (especially those adopting from China and Guatemala) find <br/>themselves repeating the entire immigration application two or three times. This <br/>can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars--money many of us <br/>simply do not have. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing <br/>applications and with its customer service. Processing throughout the regional <br/>offices is erratic--some I-600A applications take months to process, while <br/>individuals in other districts received approval of the exact same form within ten <br/>days. The refusal of officials to give adoptive parents priority results in children <br/>languishing in orphanages or foster care overseas for months and months at a <br/>time. Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers (I-140) and <br/>employment authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 and 1.97 months, <br/>respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned child (3.39 months). There is no <br/>explanation for why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected 859,543 I-765 <br/>and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A applicants. Why<br/>are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given greater scrutiny than adult <br/>foreign workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are met with deaf <br/>ears and directed to a &quot;status&quot; website which is not updated. As a result of <br/>USCIS&#39; refusal to prioritize orphan petitions, thousands of children suffer <br/>needlessly. There has been no move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive <br/>parents whose documents &quot;expire&quot; while they wait for their child&#39;s home country <br/>to grant them approval to travel. These parents are forced to reapply with USCIS, <br/>repaying the same exorbitant fees two and sometimes three additional times, <br/>each time subjecting themselves to the same long and uncertain wait for <br/>immigration approval. If USCIS would simply extend the &quot;expiration&quot; deadline for <br/>the I-171H from eighteen months to three years, it would significantly reduce its <br/>workload without having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for what it needs, it is <br/>asking for what it wants. It claims that this fee increase is designed to provide for <br/>an adequate and sustainable level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and <br/>processes designed to improve the USCIS&#39; ability to administer the nation&#39;s <br/>immigration laws. The Bureau justifies these increases by asserting that this fee <br/>rule would provide the necessary resources to maintain these processing time <br/>standards and fund further improvements to USCIS business operations to <br/>continue to reduce processing times while ensuring the appropriate level of <br/>security.<br/><br/>There are very few infants infiltrating Al-Qaeda. After all that adoptive parents have <br/>had to account for, and after all of the information that adoptive parents have had <br/>to make available, the idea that adoptive parents are a threat to national security <br/>is laughable. The additional levels of scrutiny on orphaned children and their <br/>prospective parents is absurd. <br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud, improving <br/>service, changing benefit applications from paper to electronic means in order to <br/>streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to bear the burden of these goals <br/>is unconscionable. Worse still, many of USCIS&#39; stated aims do not directly benefit <br/>those seeking to immigrate. <br/><br/>Increasing the burden on adoptive parents is not simply unfair, it is detrimental to <br/>the lives of waiting children. We urge rejection of the current proposal and a new <br/>requirement that USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first <br/>priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork required for orphan <br/>petitions, and extend the &quot;expiration&quot; of the I-171H from eighteen months to three <br/>years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Novella Elam<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b74a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:27:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T21:52:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Novella S.
