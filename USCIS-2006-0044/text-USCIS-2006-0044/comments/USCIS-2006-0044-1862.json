As prospective adoptive parents, <br/>we are required to sumbit ourselves to numerous policies and procedures, which if <br/>those seeking to be parents &quot;the normal way&quot; were to submit to, we would have <br/>zero population growth. We have to prove we are decent, hard-working, law-<br/>abiding, physically and mentally competent people. We also have to prove we can <br/>afford to raise a child. That says nothing about we can afford the adoption <br/>proceedure. <br/><br/>Raising the cost of filing orphan petitions, and other paperwork related to adoption <br/>seems very unfair. The proposed increases will add hundreds more to the cost of <br/>adoptiing a needy child from another country. These children need loving homes, <br/>and in effect, they are the ones being penalized by the increased fees. <br/><br/>Please reconsider the increase in fees. Say &quot;NO&quot; to the proposed change. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a8fa", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:55:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T18:14:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021a8fa", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1862/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1862/attachments"}}}}}
