My husband and I are in the process of<br/>adopting a baby from China.  We logged in to China in April of 2006, but<br/>unfortunately the wait has become very long.  Along with the extended wait time,<br/>the total adoption cost will be affected due to the need for re-filing,<br/>re-fingerprinting and an updated home study.  These factors can not be changed,<br/>however any increase in fees will make the refiling even more costly.  I ask you<br/>to please reconsider the fee increase.  If there must be an increase, would it<br/>be possible to exempt those who are in a situation like us and simply not apply<br/>the new increased amount for those refiling?  Thank you for your time and<br/>consideration.<br/>   Sheila Johnson<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a05c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:14:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-20T21:45:43Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sheila S.
