US<br/>Citizens are trying to adopt children to add to their families as well as give<br/>children a home who may otherwise grow up with out a family.  The cost of<br/>adoption is already very costly.  To raise the fees by this substantial amount<br/>will hurt many people trying to adopt children. In addition, I wonder if the<br/>department has considered the amount of economic revenue brought to the country<br/>when these children enter.  The parents adopting the children raise them like<br/>any other American citizen and their adoption helps create revenue for the<br/>American economy.  The government needs to reconsider these fees and give these<br/>families trying to adopt children a break for once.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e56b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:38:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T21:38:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021e56b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2690/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2690/attachments"}}}}}
