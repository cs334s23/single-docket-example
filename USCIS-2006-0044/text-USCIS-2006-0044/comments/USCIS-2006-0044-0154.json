By more than doubling the total immigration<br/>fees, you are creating an environment, a United States, that exists solely for<br/>those immigrants who have deep pockets. You are also creating an environment<br/>that increases the separation of family immigrants, for although people might be<br/>able to support themselves once IN the United States, many people are coming<br/>from countries in which they are unable to gain enough money to pay these<br/>increased fees. In fact, many people have been saving money just to pay the<br/>already substantial $400 immigration fees. By more than doubling the immigration<br/>fees, you are delaying their possible immigration, and you are causing families<br/>to break apart. Where once four members of a family could immigrate together,<br/>due to increased fees only two can... if they can find an additional $150<br/>dollars. Although I support increased fees as overhead costs have increased, I<br/>do not support more than doubling the total immigration fees, but instead a less<br/>drastic increase... possibly $500 for the total immigration fees. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa325", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T16:29:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-03T20:17:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Rocio G.
