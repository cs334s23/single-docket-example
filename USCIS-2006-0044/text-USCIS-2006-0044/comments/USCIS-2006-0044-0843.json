I am a US citizen married to a foreign <br/>national who is hoping to naturalize in two years.  If the proposed fee increases go <br/>into effect it will absolutely keep him from applying.  We are a young, middle <br/>class couple.  I go to school full time and work part time, and he is employed full <br/>time.  There is no way we could come up with the increased filing fees.  It&#39;s not <br/>about citizenship being something one must be willing to sacrifice for.  We do <br/>value citizenship, and we have both sacrificed substantially (financially and <br/>otherwise) just for him to become a Legal Permanent Resident.  The citizenship <br/>fees as they stand will be a challenge for us to pay.  If the proposed fee increases <br/>go into effect, his citizenship will be delayed for years.  It wouldn&#39;t be financially <br/>responsible for us to even consider applying until I am out of school, some of my <br/>student loans are paid off, and we have secured other costly priorities such as <br/>health insurance.   <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020adc8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-23T19:28:20Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-23T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-23T18:02:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Rebecca L.
