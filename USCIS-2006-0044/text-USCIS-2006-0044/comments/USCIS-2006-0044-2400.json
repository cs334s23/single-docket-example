I recommend that the <br/>fees remain at current rates, as many families must file 2x because the approval <br/>to adopt is only valid for 18 months, and the USCIS does not permit renewal at a <br/>reduced rate.  <br/>The proposed increase is almost $1,000-over 140%, with no increase in services <br/>or expediency!  This also does NOT take into consideration the increase in charge <br/>for my child&#39;s IR4 visa-another 120% increase!  Sometimes this certificate of <br/>citizenship can take upwards of a year.  <br/>International adoption is a financially draining experience for the average American, <br/>with current expenses reaching $40,000 and beyond, potentially.  By increasing <br/>the USCIS fees, you are further limiting the ability of many Americans to grow their <br/>families by adoption.  <br/>Please reconsider this fee increase proposal as it relates to adoption fees, and <br/>keep them at current rates.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ce84", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:50:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T17:59:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa Sargavakian", "trackingNbr": "8021ce84", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2400/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2400/attachments"}}}}}
