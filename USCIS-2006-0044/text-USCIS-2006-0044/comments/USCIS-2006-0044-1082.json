We are <br/>adopting from China and the wait has become much longer recently.  We are <br/>looking at having to renew our application at least once, if not twice.  The costs <br/>associated with adoption are already difficult for many families and this fee <br/>increase will only make it worse.  Please consider this: had we given birth to this <br/>child we would not have to ask for approval, get fingerprinted, or pay fees.  We <br/>want to bring an orphan child into our home and would like you to consider the <br/>implications of a fee increase and whether or not it is fair.  We are asking that you <br/>do not increase the fees.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Ann Densmore<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020de29", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-07T18:41:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-07T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-06T00:31:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Ann R.
