The Federal Government has <br/>emphatically expressed support for international adoption in recent years by <br/>providing a substantial tax benefit to alleviate the financial burden of adoption in <br/>general.  An increase in USCIS fees related to the international adoption process <br/>would only work against the forward progress of making international adoption a <br/>viable option to many prospective adoptive families.  In essence, an increase in <br/>fees related to international adoption would work directly against the adoption tax <br/>benefit afforded to us by the Federal Government.  The fee revenue with respect to <br/>international adoption is a small percentage of the total revenue generated from <br/>immigration related fees.  Tax paying Americans who choose to pursue <br/>international adoption should not be required to pay excessive fees for a service <br/>that should be supportive to their efforts instead of restrictive.  Again, I respectfully <br/>propose that USCIS fees related to international adoption be excluded from the fee <br/>increase that is prescribed in the proposed rule.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b1c9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T00:44:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T11:51:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Charles W.
