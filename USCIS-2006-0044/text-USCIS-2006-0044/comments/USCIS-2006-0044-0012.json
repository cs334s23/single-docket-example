This is unacceptable.  It is<br/>understandable to have occasional cost increases to meet the rise of inflation.<br/> However, the proposed increase is too high.  Making immigrants pay such higher<br/>fees makes it that much harder for them to become financially independent and<br/>stable members of our society.

Immigrants<br/>need support-the support of their families, the support of a job with a living<br/>wage, and the support of their new government.

Many clients cannot even pay for the modest<br/>service fee that is charged at my organization, and must also apply for fee<br/>waivers when filing papers with USCIS.
