I don&#39;t think USCIS need to increase it by that <br/>much in order make up the costs of processing applications and fund <br/>improvements in service, besides the service USCIS offers is terrible, the clerks <br/>and incaplable of dealing with the public, and the wait for people to obtain any <br/>benefit, is terribly long.  It is obvious we in the USA have a broken immigration <br/>system. <br/><br/>Plus, USCIS been a department of the government should ask congress for <br/>funding from tax payers.  I as a US Citizen and taxpayer feel that immigrants <br/>should not have to cover expenses that should be paid by the goverment.  Also, I <br/>know for a fact that thousands of people submitt applications for different <br/>immigration benefits, with an already expensive fee.  USCIS should be able to <br/>cover all the expenses they have with the money that is already bringing in. <br/><br/>Also, my last comment is:  I HOPE THESE INCREASES ARE NOT BEEN DONE <br/>IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE WAR IN IRAK. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480214cdf", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-19T15:34:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-19T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-17T02:04:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Rodolfo Nunez", "trackingNbr": "80214cdf", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1299/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1299/attachments"}}}}}
