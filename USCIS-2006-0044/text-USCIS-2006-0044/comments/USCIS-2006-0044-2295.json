I am recommending that<br/>the fees be held at the current rates, as many families must file twice because<br/>the approval to adopt is only valid for 18 months and the USCIS does not permit<br/>renewal at a reduced rate.  This means families must pay full price twice.  <br/><br/>Here is what it currently costs to file with USCIS for a couple just to adopt:<br/><br/>What it used to be when adoptions took place within 18 months:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 or over 140%! That&#39;s how much more USCIS will be<br/>charging me, as well as other adoptive parents, with no increase in services.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the calculation above is not taking into consideration the fact<br/>that applying for my child&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) will go<br/>from $215 to $460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase. Perhaps if I<br/>could expect speedy service, this increase might be justified, however in many<br/>cases the certificate is not received for a year after filing.<br/><br/>International adoption is a financially draining process for the average<br/>American, with current expenses ranging from $25,000 to $40,000.  By increasing<br/>the USCIS fees, you are further limiting the ability of many Americans to make<br/>their family through the adoption process.  Please reconsider the fee increase<br/>proposal as it relates to adoption fees and hold the current rates.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cd96", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:03:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T16:09:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Stephanie Legrand", "trackingNbr": "8021cd96", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2295/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2295/attachments"}}}}}
