The process is already hugely <br/>expensive, and increasing these fees by such an inordinate amount is just <br/>unconscionable.  Adoptive parents are hard working, tax paying US citizens, who are <br/>rescuing a baby from a life of poverty, and many of us are nearly broke ourselves <br/>because of it.  <br/><br/>The cost of reviewing a form and mailing a piece of paper back, a process that must <br/>take minutes to complete, is already exorbitant.
