While I <br/>respect the inconvenience and cost to USCIS of replacing lost I-94 cards or <br/>EADs, doubling the fees for these services is extreme. Inflation and supply costs <br/>have certainly not doubled in the last several years and to charge students who <br/>already pay out of state tuition higher fees for replacement documents is <br/>unacceptable. Students at community colleges are often unable to obtain on-<br/>campus employment and therefore are limited in their ability to earn additional <br/>income like their counterparts at universities. In addition, these students are often <br/>from less affluent families and the additional burden of these fees is tremendous.<br/><br/>Many of the other fee increases listed are even more extreme and while I cannot <br/>speak to these professionally because I do not work with this population, I am <br/>concerned at the seemingly arbitrary decisions and exhorbitant fee increases <br/>being imposed upon a largely underemployed and struggling group of immigrants.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020973a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:49:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-20T13:50:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Heath Shuler", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rebecca Howell", "trackingNbr": "8020973a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0748/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0748/attachments"}}}}}
