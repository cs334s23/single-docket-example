It is unfair to raise the application fees by 80 per cent at one<br/>time. If USCIS wants to raise the application fees then they should be raised in<br/>phases at say 10 per cent per year for the next eight years.<br/> <br/>The increase in fees will put many individual and families in financial<br/>hardship. I have a family and will end up paying thousands in applications and<br/>lawyer fees. This is a big investment on the part of the potential immigrant. I<br/>have been waiting for over five years and  have still not received by green<br/>card. Hence, I think it is unjustified that USCIS increase their fees without<br/>improving their services to the public.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207718", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:37:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T14:14:50Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Mehmood Zafar", "trackingNbr": "80207718", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0451/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0451/attachments"}}}}}
