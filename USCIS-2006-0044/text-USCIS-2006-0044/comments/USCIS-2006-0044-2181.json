As a parent <br/>that has one internationally adopted child and in the process of adopting a second <br/>child, the costs are already a significant burden.  The fees for documents like the I-<br/>600, I-600A, N-600, and N-565 already had a significant price increase since <br/>2003, and a second major price increase will add to the financial burden of <br/>international adoption.  There are many children in the world that need a loving, <br/>permanent family but Federal, State, and Local governments continue to make the <br/>process more difficult and more expensive.  These price increases will continue <br/>reducing the number of prospective parents choosing adoption as a way to create <br/>their family because they simply cannot afford it.  Please reconsider these <br/>exceptionally large fee increases as they are not reasonable.
