Currently my family is approaching the end of our adoption of an orphan <br/>from China, and the most difficult part of the process for us has been dealing with <br/>the USCIS. <br/><br/>Since the I-600A only lasts 18 months, it is IMPOSSIBLE to complete the <br/>adoption before it expires, so we will be subject to more fees, money which could <br/>be much better spent on providing for the child.<br/><br/>I urge you to abandon these fee increases, and further suggest that the current fee <br/>structure should in fact be reduced.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219dff", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:37:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:54:59Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Roger", "trackingNbr": "80219dff", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1677/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1677/attachments"}}}}}
