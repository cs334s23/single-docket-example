I am married with Two  adult kids.  We came here since last July 2002 <br/>and we are just waiting our Five Years Term this July 2007 to apply for a <br/>Citizenship.  However, that you have a proposed Application Fee Hike.  I&#39;m worried <br/>that you will implement that raised as soon as possible before my filling term.  It&#39;s <br/>really expensive for us to pay for Four (4) Person for the filling fee of $1,600 <br/>including the Fingerprinting Fee.  We are just in the middle class of society and <br/>receiving just enough for us to live here in America and support my Two kids in <br/>College/University.  What more if you will raise the amount for 85%?  That will be <br/>$2,960 for all of us just for one family.  This is too much money for us to in spite of <br/>the on going proposed Increases.<br/><br/>If you will permit/allow us to file now, We really appreciate it.  We are just hoping <br/>that you will allowed us to file as soon as possible before the increase will be <br/>implemented.<br/><br/>Thank you and more power.<br/><br/>Yours truly,<br/><br/>Mrs. Flocer Sobrera<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fb61e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-06T17:07:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-06T15:09:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Flocer Sobrera", "trackingNbr": "801fb61e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0192/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0192/attachments"}}}}}
