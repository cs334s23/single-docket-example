We think it is <br/>unfair and unreasonable that due to the extended wait that is imposed by the <br/>Chinese government (waiting for our child match), that we would be penalized by <br/>paying higher fees to re-file our I-600A paperwork with the USCIS.  We are <br/>disappionted that the government would charge us fee&#39;s again, much less that <br/>they would be higher than what we paid before for our original paperwork.<br/><br/>We ask that the government offer a waiver to families that are currently waiting for <br/>a child match, and that they would extend the deadline OR not impose the higher <br/>fee&#39;s should our I-171H expire prior to child match.
