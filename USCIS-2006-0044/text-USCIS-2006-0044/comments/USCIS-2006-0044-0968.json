I <br/>cannot believe that EVERY year the fee is not raised and this is LONG overdue!  <br/>WHY do we want to encourage &quot;low-income&quot; immigrators?  That&#39;s ridiculous!  The <br/>benefits received once they are citizens are SO much more than the fee&#39;s they are <br/>paying AND that is not even being considered.  I believe user fees SHOULD fund <br/>the entire USCIS budget and also should fund other areas where immigrants are <br/>getting a FREE ride now.  I DO NOT want Congress appropriating discretionary <br/>funds for immigration...not even $1.<br/><br/>I know this is OPEN to public comment...but I do not believe anyone who is NOT <br/>currently a citizen should even be heard...they have NO right to comment on the <br/>fee&#39;s when they currently have NO voting rights in this Country!<br/><br/>If User fees can&#39;t keep the immigration agency up to date, then the fee&#39;s should be <br/>increased to a level that they CAN.  Why are taxpayers paying for this?  <br/><br/>We jail our border agents when they do their job and so the message is we are pro-<br/>immigration.  Well, I am ONE US Citizen who is NOT pro-immigration as they will <br/>eventually out-number the REAL Americans at the rate we are going.  Congress <br/>needs to wake-up and reallt get a better feel for what they are doing to the <br/>landscape of America!<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing my comments.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020c242", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-28T16:08:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-28T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-27T20:30:50Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cheryl L.
