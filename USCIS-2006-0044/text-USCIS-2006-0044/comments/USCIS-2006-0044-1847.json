This has been a <br/>huge process for them.  They have four children and are not &quot;rich&quot;.  To qualify to <br/>adopt a baby from China they have both had to take on extra jobs to earn enough <br/>to have the minimum financial requirements.  I have no doubt that they will be <br/>wonderful parents and give this baby a loving home.  <br/><br/>However, in raising the fees necessary for adoption you are further pressuring a <br/>family that is already making a selfless sacrifice.  Can&#39;t our agency representing <br/>and assisting potential adoptive parents look at other avenues of getting more <br/>monies rather than taxing the financially burdened parents?  How much more do <br/>you want out of parents already sacrificing so much?<br/><br/>Thanks for your time,<br/>Nadine E.
