It is also risky. Many people pay  thousands of <br/>dollars and have failed adoptions. Adoptive parents are at the mercy of regulators from two <br/>goverments. As an American Citizen if I have a child biologically I pay no fees for their <br/>citizenship. If I adopt internationally I understand there are some fees involved. However, the <br/>system as it is now is explotive. Often the adoption processs takes more that 18 months.Then <br/>parents are forced to pay these fees twice. So if you raise them you should extend the validity <br/>time to 36 months. Also how do fingerprints expire? Why can&#39;t the prints, once taken, be rerun <br/>through every six months? Remember we have to have clean crimnal records to adopt in the <br/>first place. <br/>Please remember that the vast majority of us are people desperate to have familis and this is our <br/>only way. Please do not add the US gov. to the many people out there ready to take advantage <br/>of our situation.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020772b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:47:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T14:29:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anne L.
