If we are truly trying to encourage Americans <br/>to adopt children overseas (and with some of the rules regarding domestic <br/>adoption I can only assume that is what we are trying to encourage), then we <br/>should make the process as simple and painless as possible.  An I -171H that <br/>expires in 18 months and is accompanied by fingerprints that expire in 15 months <br/>is just ludicrous - something akin to hot dogs in packages of ten and buns in <br/>packages of eight.  The process should be modified to something that makes <br/>sense.  This would reduce the costs involved.  For example, 1) make the I-171H <br/>and the fingerprints expire at the same time and 2) make an I-171H good for at <br/>least 24 months.  This first step would reduce the number of times people would <br/>have to be fingerprinted. The second step would reduce re-filings and more align <br/>the validity of an I-171H with the current time lines for foreign adoptions, unless <br/>you happen to be Madonna or Angelina Jolie - then it only takes a couple of <br/>month anyway.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020efff", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T17:39:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-07T21:56:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Christopher B.
