First of all, and mainly, because of the low <br/>posibilities offered to immigrants to work in US. at this point, I&#39;m talking about a <br/>clerical/administrative job, since to find a professional job can represents a really <br/>challenge for those who came from their country planning to restart their lives in <br/>US.<br/>The bottom line is....for most part of the time, people who have a strong <br/>background and a good academic level find themselves working in a position <br/>(when can find a job in his specific professional area) pretty much in low <br/>level...doing less intelectual works than he really could be done. thats <br/>means....loww salary, sometimes a lot of work....short time....and a big challenge <br/>to live in US paying to much for utilities, rent, etc.<br/>On another hand....there are many people mwho can&#39;t afford living in US and have <br/>been struggling to survive working too much and having a salary that don&#39;t allow <br/>them to pay for their main, essential subsistence.<br/>Raise the fee will, for sure, make impossible and or hard for most part of <br/>immigrants living here no matter what&#39;s his specific situation.<br/>What&#39;s expected by Immigration Service is some kind of support of those who <br/>have being going though many stressful situation related to restarting a new life in <br/>a different country, dealing, sometimes, with the cultural and emotional <br/>shock...that came together with a very stressful financial crisis, for most part of <br/>the time.<br/>On another hand, these justifications presented to raise (and make hard thousand <br/>of people&#39;s lifes) just doens&#39;t justify, since there are not a main reason and /or <br/>benefits for the candidates.<br/>Finally, to raise fees will raise the number of immigrants living here in illegal <br/>status...and will increase the number of people working in illegal way.....not <br/>paying for Social Security and taxes......bringing trouble to the United States and <br/>it&#39;s governments.<br/>Please, realize that trying to make immigrants&#39;s lives hard in US can bring bad <br/>consequences for the country&#39;s economy. So, be smart and try to punish just <br/>those whom deserve it..not all immigrants, because some are here looking for a <br/>opportunity to contribute in very positive way to make US grow. And...sometimes, <br/>the immigrant are here for something else that envolves being proud of this <br/>country and asshamed of his own political innitiatives..therefore....a lot of people <br/>here deserve to be reward and incentivate to stay here and give their best!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9a3b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:19:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T01:05:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tereza R.
