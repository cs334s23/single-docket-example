I think it is unconsciousable  to raise fees and make <br/>adoption an even more expensive, difficult process than it already is.  I would like to <br/>suggest that the current fees should be held constant instead of raised as other USCIS <br/>fees.  Based on the proposed changes, our family will be spending an additional $1000 <br/>(possibly $2000, since the paperwork may expire before our adoption is finalized and <br/>we will have to refile) in adoption related expenses--on top of the already high cost of <br/>the adoption process in general.  Please consider those of us who are already <br/>stretching ourselves to the limits to bring a child home and make a family.  An extra <br/>$1000 to $2000 is a HUGE difference to those of us struggling to make this happen.  <br/>Thank you for your consideration.  Kyla and Eric Hartunian  U.S. Army Ft.
