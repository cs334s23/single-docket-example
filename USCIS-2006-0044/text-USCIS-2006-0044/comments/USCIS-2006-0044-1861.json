These<br/>fees already represent a financial barrier to many families hoping to take in<br/>children in need of a family, and to raise them further will prevent more<br/>children from finding permanent homes. Adoption is already an extremely<br/>expensive process, usually approaching $20,000 in costs or more, and although<br/>potential adoptive families can do their best to keep costs down, the USCIS fees<br/>apply in all situations--and families must of course pay the fees more than once<br/>when adopting the very children who are hardest to place--sibling sets. <br/><br/>An increase in these fees will also be especially harmful to lower-income<br/>families seeking to adopt. My family is already struggling to finance the<br/>adoption of a child in need, and since we are lower income, we will not receive<br/>the full benefit of the tax credits meant to help families. Since our citizens<br/>and government have repeatedly affirmed that the adoption of children in need<br/>into loving U.S. families is a good thing, please do not make this harder to<br/>achieve by raising the adoption-related USCIS fees further. I understand that<br/>due to concerns about security and immigration, the USCIS may be under pressure<br/>to do more with less money at this time, but adoptive parents--and the children<br/>waiting to join their families--should not be the ones to bear this burden.<br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a7bf", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:55:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T16:00:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Wendy Wetzel", "trackingNbr": "8021a7bf", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1861/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1861/attachments"}}}}}
