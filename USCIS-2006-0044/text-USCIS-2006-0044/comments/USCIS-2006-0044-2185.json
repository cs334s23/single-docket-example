Adoption is already so expensive that very few can go<br/>through the process with out financial assistance.  Adopting parents are<br/>required to jump through so many hoops it is ridiculous.  I know our government<br/>agencies are functioning on shrinking budgets but I believe there has to be a<br/>better option than raising these fees.  Our CIS fees are already outrageous and<br/>unless it can be better explained I absolutely do not see a reason for<br/>increasing these fees.  I ask that you please reconsider these fee changes and<br/>honestly look at options that wouldn&#39;t make adoption any more financially<br/>demanding than it already is.  Thank you for your time and consideration. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021babd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T01:40:04Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T12:00:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kayla Dutton", "trackingNbr": "8021babd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2185/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2185/attachments"}}}}}
