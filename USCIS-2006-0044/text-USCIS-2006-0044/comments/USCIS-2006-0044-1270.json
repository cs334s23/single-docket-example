It should be<br/>pointed out that its customers are taxpayers and any increase in rates is<br/>essentially an increase in taxes - in exchange for poor service.  I can be<br/>fingerprinted for free by my local police department, but this is not good<br/>enough for USCIS! They apparently have the need for special fingerprints... more<br/>special than the free fingerprints that I need to have taken yearly for other<br/>FBI clearances related to my job.  How about this: quit trying to make a profit,<br/>treat taxpayers like humans, shorten your wait times, shorten the wait for<br/>paperwork, stop being domineering and authoritative, get rid of Barney Fife with<br/>the metal detector at the door (especially followed by the bullet-proof glass<br/>windows; I mean, is he that bad at searching that you still need physically<br/>separated from the people that you serve), and finally, instead of raising rates<br/>for prints - allow people to get them wherever they please!  The USCIS is an<br/>example of everything that is wrong with the federal government!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802136b2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-14T14:00:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-14T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-13T19:33:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By John W.
