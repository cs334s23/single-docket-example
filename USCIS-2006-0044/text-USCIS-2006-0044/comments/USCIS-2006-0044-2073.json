After being told by my doctor that we could not have another <br/>child we began to look at adoption as a viable option. It is a great deal of money <br/>about 20,000 to adopt from China, and as two educators it is a huge strain on our <br/>budget, but we decided to pursue it as it seemed a relilable process.<br/>However with an ever lenghtening time-frame to adopt our daughter, we are sadded <br/>that not only will we have to wait at least 18 more months to get her, but we will <br/>also have to renew most of our paperwork through the USCIS during this time as it <br/>will all expire before we travel. Please, please consider not increasing these fees <br/>as we already will be having to pay them twice as it is. <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jennifer Parker<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b867", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T23:43:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T02:00:22Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jennifer Parker", "trackingNbr": "8021b867", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2073/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2073/attachments"}}}}}
