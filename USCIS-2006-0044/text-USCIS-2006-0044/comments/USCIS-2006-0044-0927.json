Also, the fingerprinting (that is required) for the I-171 should <br/>be extended to match the length of the I-171.  Currently, fingerprints are only good <br/>for 12 months.  With China&#39;s wait times extended to 16-18 months, many of us are <br/>refiling ALL this paperwork.  It is another cost and stressor in a process that has <br/>become over-crowded with fees, additional fees, unexpected increases in fees, <br/>and stress-upon-stress in what is and SHOULD be a wonderful, exciting, and <br/>magical time of building a family.<br/>Thank you!<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Bonnie Behling<br/>in-process adoptive parent <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020b555", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T15:02:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-25T02:51:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Lundgren", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Bonnie Behling", "trackingNbr": "8020b555", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0927/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0927/attachments"}}}}}
