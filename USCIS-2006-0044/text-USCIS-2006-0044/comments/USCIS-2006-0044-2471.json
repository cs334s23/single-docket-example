With our latest international <br/>adoption we have already had to pay the price for approval twice since the <br/>paperwork is only good for 18 months. That was hard enough, I can&#39;t even imagine <br/>how we could afford such robbery if we were in need for the third process. This <br/>increase guarantees that we will not be able to adopt again.<br/>For each family that you discourage from adopting due to these expenses you are <br/>risking the life of an innocent child. That is one child that will be left behind and <br/>their lives changed forever.<br/>I would like to hear the rationale for the enormous increase in fees when no extra <br/>services are to be provided. It is basically extorsion--I want a family and the only <br/>way that is going to happen is through adoption so you have me over a barrel...so <br/>if I don&#39;t pay it--I have no family???  I just feel like my government is sticking a <br/>knife in my back when I have already had to deal with my own bodies disloyalty <br/>with infertility. I would love to have a conversation with the genius that thought up <br/>these increases, they have obviously not needed or wanted to adopt a child. You <br/>have no idea what the ramifications are if these prices go through. You are <br/>changing the world--one child at a time, but not for the better. <br/>I am ashamed of you all.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d88e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:38:58Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T02:32:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jennifer Ames", "trackingNbr": "8021d88e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2471/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2471/attachments"}}}}}
