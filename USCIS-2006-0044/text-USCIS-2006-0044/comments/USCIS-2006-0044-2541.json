While I understand fees must be increased from time to <br/>time, some of the increases are astronomical. For example, the fee for filing Form <br/>N-600 (Application for Certificate of Citizenship) is proposed to increase by <br/>EIGHTY PERCENT. The fee for Form N-565, used to formally change an adopted <br/>child&#39;s name, is proposed to increase by over SEVENTY-TWO PERCENT. I <br/>believe the fee hike for these two particular forms should be lowered to a more <br/>reasonable 20%, which is in line with the proposed fee increases for other related <br/>forms.  Lastly, I would like to strongly suggest that increased fees be used to <br/>increase USCIS staff, so that international adoptions may be processed more <br/>quickly and efficiently.
