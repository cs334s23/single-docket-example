With a 66% increase even my salary doesn&#39;t <br/>increase at that rate.  It seems to be taking longer to have documents approved <br/>and most must have the documents renewed for a second time, at the same <br/>cost.  This makes the original fee almost double than what is stated. Do not raise <br/>the rate unless you can offer something in exchange!<br/><br/>Best Regards,<br/>Tracy Osborne<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a3c2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:49:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T09:27:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tracy G.
