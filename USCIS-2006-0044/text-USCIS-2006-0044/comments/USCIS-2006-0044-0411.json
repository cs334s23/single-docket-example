The<br/>exorbitant fee increase is justified if and only if all the money collected is<br/>used by the agency to improve the broken immigration benefit system. There is a<br/>considerable amount of doubt that the money collected via immigration fees are<br/>used to finance border security and not merely to cover the administrative and<br/>service expenses.<br/><br/>It looks like that the department of homeland security considers the immigration<br/>applicant pool as the goose that lays golden eggs, and now, the department is<br/>bent on killing this goose to get more money. <br/><br/>On one hand, the government talks about  tax relief, but on the other hand, they<br/>nullify the relief by such exorbitant fee increases from the constituents. <br/><br/>Please stop this fee increase.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206ae8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T00:42:28Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T22:46:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Dilipkumar V.
