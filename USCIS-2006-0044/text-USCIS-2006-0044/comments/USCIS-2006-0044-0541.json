The wait <br/>from time of application to referral has lengthened signifigantly since we started <br/>this process in January of 2006.  We are very concerned with the possibility of the <br/>increase in fees by USCIS.  Having to re-file another I-171H form and be <br/>refingerprinted is a huge (an unexpected) financial burden as it is, but to increase <br/>the fees does not seem fair at all.  Please do not add this extra cost and stress <br/>for adoptive families who have already had to go through so much to bring their <br/>precious children home!  Pease do your part to help us share the love of a family <br/>with an orphan who has so little!  Thank you very much for your time and <br/>consideration concerning this issue.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Amy E.
