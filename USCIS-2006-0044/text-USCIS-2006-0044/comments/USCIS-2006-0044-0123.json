The fees<br/>are already out of the reach of many immigrants.  I personally know immigrants<br/>who qualify for benefits but cannot apply because they cannot pay the fees as<br/>they stand.  Doubling and, in some cases, tripling of these fees will only<br/>prevent more people from applying for benefits.  Not only is this an unfair<br/>burden, it only serves to further increase the population of undocumented<br/>individuals in the US.  The larger this population gets, the easier it will be<br/>for terrorists to hide within the US.  This will create a larger and larger ring<br/>of counterfeiters of driver&#39;s licenses, social security numbers, etc.  It will<br/>encourage identity theft and tax law enforcement resources rather than allowing<br/>them to focus on real threats to our peace and order.  The Immigration Service<br/>should be adopting policies, as well as fees, that encourage individuals to come<br/>forward, out of the shadows.  There are no other government benefits that<br/>require such an enormous fee or that have increased at such a dramatic rate over<br/>the past 10 years.  The rate increases have far exceeded the rate of inflation<br/>and have not resulted in any increase in quality of service or greater<br/>accountability of those in the US.  The fee increases are unconscionable.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa177", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T18:51:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T18:39:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jeffrey Martins, Law Office of Jeffrey Martins", "trackingNbr": "801fa177", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0123/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0123/attachments"}}}}}
