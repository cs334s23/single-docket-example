Individuals who use these services <br/>to be become legal residents or citizens of the United States (and other services)<br/>face enough financial hardships, these increases only make it more difficult for law-<br/>abiding indivuduals to receive the services they need. Clearly we are sending the <br/>wrong message to these inidivuals that they are not welcome here, this is excatly <br/>the opposite of the principals this country was founded on. Furthermore, these <br/>increases mean it is only more likely that indivuals will continue to reside in the <br/>country illegally. Instead of raising fees astronomically, alternate means of funding <br/>from the govemment should be found if more money is indeed required. <br/>Furthermore, raising fees to possibly only maintain service levels and processing <br/>time is absolutely unacceptable. The agency should find a way to operate more <br/>efficiently, improve processing time, and restructure/get alternate funding, rather <br/>than adding fees.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802164ad", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-20T13:40:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-20T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-19T21:54:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "802164ad", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1312/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1312/attachments"}}}}}
