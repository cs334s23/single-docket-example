It is a financial hardship for families who are endeavoring <br/>to adopt an orphan.  The fee increase will adversely affect so many families <br/>because, due to the regulation that the I-171H expires after 18 months, many <br/>families will have to re-file (and hence re-pay for) their I-600A, so please do not <br/>increase these fees; it&#39;s difficult enough that we will have to repay to refile, please <br/>don&#39;t make it worse by raising these fees.
