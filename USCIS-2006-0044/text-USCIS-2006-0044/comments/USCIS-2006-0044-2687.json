Wilkins, am an adoptive parent to a daughter from China. When I was <br/>completeing paperwork a few years ago, it cost approximately $700 in fees to the <br/>USCIS for the I600-A and the fingerprints. With the proposed rate changes along <br/>with the &quot;expiration&quot; dates of the I600-A and fingerprints (which I don&#39;t <br/>understand...how can fingerprints &quot;expire?&quot;), it would cost more than $1600 for the <br/>SAME services! I do not think this is fair to adoptive parents, who are already <br/>beset with fees from their adoption agency, the country of origin of their child and <br/>others. I fear that it could discourage potential parents from adopting, and lead to <br/>more children without homes.<br/><br/>The other increase I oppose is the increase in fees for the Certificate of <br/>Citizenship for children who arrived in-country on an IR-4 visa. Those children are <br/>legally citizens, and I feel their parents should not have to pay to prove it, much <br/>less pay almost $500.<br/><br/>Please reconsider these increases and think about what is in the best interests of <br/>the children and families.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms. Lee Wilkins<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e54e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:38:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T21:14:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tamara Wilkins", "trackingNbr": "8021e54e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2687/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2687/attachments"}}}}}
