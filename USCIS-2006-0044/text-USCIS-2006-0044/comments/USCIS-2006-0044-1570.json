We all benefit from <br/>increases in legal immigration and citizenship ? economically and culturally. <br/>Immigrants should be encouraged, not hindered from applying for legal status.  <br/>The new fees are not just an added expense, but would prohibit even those <br/>making a middle class income from being able to afford permanent residence or <br/>citizenship for their families.  <br/><br/>I understand that USCIS is seeking the fee increases to ensure appropriate <br/>funding to meet national security requirements and customer service needs, and <br/>to modernize an outdated business infrastructure. While I agree that service <br/>quality should be improved to eliminate the backlog and remedy misplaced cases, <br/>I do not believe that thisis the best way to accomplish those goals. Nor do I think <br/>that legal immigrants should be forced to bear this burden. Such large marginal <br/>increases are unprecedented, unnecessary and detrimental to the pursuit of the <br/>American dream.  I urge you to find other ways to more efficiently use your current <br/>budget and to raise funds for technology needs.<br/><br/>I have written to my Senators and Congressman urging them to support proposed <br/>Senate and House measures that would prevent the fee increases from taking <br/>effect and I urge others to do the same.<br/><br/>Thank you. <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480218e20", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-26T15:50:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-26T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-23T17:00:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Vern Ehlers", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Erica R.
