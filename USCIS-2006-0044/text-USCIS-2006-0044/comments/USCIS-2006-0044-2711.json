I think <br/>that needs to be looked at before you raise the costs on to all of us.  I feel we <br/>already make a huge contribution as far as taxes, whether it be federal or state, <br/>and my question to you would be, What is the need to rasie these fees, and why <br/>can&#39;t finger printing last for a longer period than 15 months?  Again, I think that <br/>other options need to be addressed before you keep making all of us adoption <br/>families pay an increase that may not be necessary.<br/><br/>The government knows that all of these steps are necessary in order to complete <br/>an adoption, and I feel like I am being taken advantage of.  <br/><br/>Thank you for hearing my concerns, and I hope you take all of this into <br/>consideration before raising these prices.  Please feel free to contact me if you <br/>have any further questions regarding this matter.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e6e2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:40:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T02:08:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jessica Phiengthirath", "trackingNbr": "8021e6e2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2711/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2711/attachments"}}}}}
