As an adoptive parent we spent $35K on our adoption and every <br/>penny spent was worth it.  However, it seems that adotpion costs go up daily and <br/>and increase in USCIS fees may be enough to deter even more families from <br/>adopting.  As taxpayers, adoptive parents, are putting money into the system and <br/>should not be subjected to more out of pocket expenses for adoptions.  I do not <br/>agree with many ways the federal government handles the finances of this <br/>country.  It seems that our government has taken to the American way of being in <br/>debt up to our eyeballs.  I do not think that increases to filing the I  600A is an <br/>appropriate way to cut costs and pass that onto usually very upstanding American <br/>citizens.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration on this subject matter.<br/><br/>Summer Henson<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e131", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:05:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T07:48:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Summer Henson", "trackingNbr": "8021e131", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2627/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2627/attachments"}}}}}
