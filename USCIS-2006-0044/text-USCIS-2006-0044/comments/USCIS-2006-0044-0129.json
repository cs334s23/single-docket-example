It is sad to know that service <br/>at the moment can be much better if only the people at the desks are more willing <br/>to be efficient and effective.  At the Detroit field office, you would see 2-3 <br/>customer representatives talking and obviously not attending to anyone and yet, <br/>they would look disgustedly at the long line forming or at the rapidly growing <br/>crowd in the lobby and yet, not call the next client until after a good 20 minutes <br/>of no-nonsense I&#39;m-not-doing-anything-right-now-but-I-will-everyone-wait-<br/>anyway attitude.  Now, tell me how I can feel that hiking up the fees will improve <br/>the service of people like these?!  Had I seen an improvement in the past 10 <br/>years, I would not mind so much but, things are worse, your representatives are <br/>more abrupt and rude, and some are just plain nasty...and you expect me to just <br/>sit back and pay you more for a lousy service?!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9a93", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T20:07:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T02:40:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Ma Donna Gepilano", "trackingNbr": "801f9a93", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0129/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0129/attachments"}}}}}
