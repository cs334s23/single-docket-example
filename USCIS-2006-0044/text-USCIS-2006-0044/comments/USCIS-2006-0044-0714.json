In particular to the huge <br/>percentage hike for the application for permanent residence.  This nation is <br/>grappling with the issue of illegal immigration and I believe that placing yet another <br/>obstacle in the path of those who are trying to immigrate legally would only serve <br/>to make the problem worse.  Contrary to popular belief, the immigration process is <br/>already complex and restrictive; a complete overhaul of the process itself is <br/>needed.  In addition, the PDF document states that a fee increase would help to <br/>keep processing times within reason, since the backlog has now been <br/>significantly reduced.  I personally know of two people who have been waiting for a <br/>decision on their I-130 application for THREE YEARS!  The table you provide in <br/>the document shows the processing time for this application as six months.<br/>It seems like the fee increase is punishing those who are making the effort to do <br/>things legally.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480209452", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:46:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-18T01:06:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous ", "trackingNbr": "80209452", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0714/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0714/attachments"}}}}}
