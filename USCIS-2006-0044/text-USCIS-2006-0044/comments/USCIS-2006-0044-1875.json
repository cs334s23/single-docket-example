Those <br/>of us trying to adopt have spent thousands of dollars just to get to the point where <br/>we file this paperwork.  Many of us have had to renew our USCIS paperwork <br/>because of slow-moving countries which requries us to incur added expsense with <br/>new home studies, fingerprinting, etc. The renewal fee should be discounted, not <br/>the full lug.  Also, it is crazy that we have to pay to have fingerprints re-taken!!!  <br/>Why can&#39;t the government hand me a CD of my fingerprints for future use??  My <br/>fingerprints are NOT GOING TO CHANGE!  <br/><br/>I urge the federal government to reconsider this poor decision on raising fees.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Stefani J.
