With the extraordinary <br/>wait time for most adoptions, the current expiration date of 18 months for I600A <br/>approval and fingerprinting fees are impossible to work within. We are now paying <br/>twice for the I600A and the fingerprints. All because of something we have no <br/>control over.<br/><br/>Now, the fees for both I600A and the fingerprinting are going up. It would be one <br/>thing if the adoption could take place within the 18 months. But, the reality now is <br/>that it&#39;s virtually impossible. With the fee increases, what used to be a total (for a <br/>two-parent household) of $685 will now be $1660 becasue virtually no one is able <br/>to adopt within the 18-month timeframe. I understand that fee increases must take <br/>place, but please take into consideration the fact that the 18 months is no longer <br/>realistic. My suggestion would be to increase the expiration time frame to one that <br/>more realistically reflects the current adoption completion time frame.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>Annie Smith<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cfc2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:51:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T19:27:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Self", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Annie Smith", "trackingNbr": "8021cfc2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2413/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2413/attachments"}}}}}
