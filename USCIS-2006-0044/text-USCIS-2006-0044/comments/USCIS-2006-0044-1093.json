With the economic divide between rich<br/>and poor growing at exponential rates, and immigration becoming more and more<br/>difficult with immigrants being discriminated against on every level in our<br/>society, what has happened to the ideals on which the United States was<br/>founded?!? The Denver Post reported that these proposed increases will make the<br/>United States the most expensive country to legally immigrate to in the world!<br/>This is astounding when one considers the cost of living in many other countries<br/>is much higher than in the US.<br/><br/>Even as two chemistry Ph.D.s, my Canadian husband and I are wondering how we<br/>will afford these rates for his immigration. Perhaps we will move to Canada<br/>after all, they don&#39;t discriminate against immigrants as much, and their crime<br/>rates are much lower to boot. Plus, who can beat 1-year maternity leave!<br/><br/>Yours truly,<br/>Guinevere Murphy, Ph.D.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020f004", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T18:36:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-07T21:59:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Guinevere Murphy", "trackingNbr": "8020f004", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1093/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1093/attachments"}}}}}
