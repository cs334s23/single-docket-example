This immigration status is similar to the refugee status <br/>(Section 207 of the Act) but not quite. Refugees are exempt from paying USCIS <br/>filing fees for adjustment of status. Parolees Sec. 212(d)(5) ? as mentioned <br/>above ? are not and are required to adjust status after 1 year and 1 day in the US. <br/>Thus, DHS first brings Parolees Sec. 212(d)(5) into the US, if they are lucky and <br/>they have their work permit after 6 months they will have minimum wage jobs for <br/>about 6 months and then are asked to pay to DHS filing fees for $905/person for <br/>adjustment of status. How is that supposed to work?  In addition, those <br/>immigrants/parolees have to pay other fees: biometrics, medical exams and fees <br/>for EAD (work permit, I-765). We are talking about at least $5,000 for a family of 4 <br/>who has been only 1 year in the country and was admitted by DHS. This is such <br/>a contradiction and does not make sense. DHS is raising the fee for I-485 from <br/>$325 to $905 with the argument of becoming more efficient? Who is going to <br/>believe that? <br/>The Parolees Sec. 212(d)(5) who are admitted to the US by DHS under the C/H <br/>Entrant program are in fact refugees and should be treated as those under Section <br/>207 of the Act and exempt from the filing fees. Please take this into consideration. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fdab3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-08T19:32:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-08T17:27:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Dagmar Ruehring, Catholic Charities", "trackingNbr": "801fdab3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0252/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0252/attachments"}}}}}
