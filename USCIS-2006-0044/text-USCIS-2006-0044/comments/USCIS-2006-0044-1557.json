Under the USCIS? proposal, the fee for filing the Form N-400 would <br/>increase from $330 to $595, and the biometrics fee would increase from $70 to <br/>$80, resulting in a total increase from $400 to $675.  The proposed 69% fee hike <br/>is an unfair burden for hardworking newcomers who wish to become U.S. citizens <br/>and participate in everything that this nation has to offer.<br/><br/>Currently, many newcomer families have limited resources, and they work <br/>tirelessly to save up the money required to pay the current $400 naturalization <br/>application cost.  According to data from the U.S. Census, about one-third (36%) <br/>of non-citizen households have annual incomes that are less than $25,000.  <br/>Family members often want to pursue U.S. citizenship by applying for <br/>naturalization at the same time.  With the increase proposed by the USCIS, a <br/>family of four would confront a bill amounting to $2,700.  An exorbitant price tag <br/>should not stand in the way of families seeking to realize the American Dream. <br/><br/>I do not oppose applicants paying a fee to apply for U.S. citizenship and <br/>commend the USCIS for taking the steps to improve customer services and <br/>processing times.  I also understand that the agency believes it needs to raise <br/>fees to pay for major infrastructure investments and process enhancements, such <br/>as improvements in the timeliness of background checks, modernization of its <br/>outdated business systems, facilities improvements and enhancements in its <br/>personnel training and recruitment programs.  However, placing the full costs of <br/>these investments on the back of our nation?s legal permanent residents is driving <br/>fees to a level that immigrants simply cannot afford. <br/><br/>I urge the USCIS to work with the President and Congress to obtain appropriations <br/>to supplement fee revenue to cover costs of major USCIS expenses such as <br/>infrastructure investments, process enhancements and capital improvements.   In <br/>the past, Congress has appropriated monies to assist the USCIS in facing <br/>challenges such as its application processing backlog.  The USCIS believes it <br/>needs to make significant investments to build an Immigration Service for the 21st <br/>Century.  This is precisely the type of challenge that should be met through the <br/>partnership between applicants paying a reasonable fee and the appropriation of <br/>Congressional funding.<br/><br/>Immigrants who apply for U.S. citizenship are eager to demonstrate their <br/>commitment to this country by becoming full participants in our nation?s civic life.  <br/>If they cannot become U.S. citizens because of an unfair fee hike, we will all lose <br/>an opportunity to strengthen and revitalize our democracy.  Our nation has a <br/>tradition of welcoming newcomers because of their contributions to our economic <br/>and social progress. The USCIS? proposed fee increase is contrary to the spirit of <br/>this tradition and sends newcomers the wrong message at a time when they are <br/>seeking to embrace U.S. citizenship.  I urge you to halt the proposed <br/>naturalization fee increase, and seek appropriated funding to help cover the <br/>investments the USCIS needs to provide quality services at an affordable price. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of my views.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Elvis S.
