Many people would <br/>like to be able to afford adoption but with the spiraling costs and ever changing <br/>country requirements for adoption, many people are left unable to financially afford <br/>it, leaving many too many children in state insitutions, foster homes, or <br/>orphanages.<br/>With international adoption the timeframe continues to lengthen for many countries <br/>before a referral or match is given.  These required documents are time sensitive <br/>and in many cases expire before a referral is made, making it necessary for <br/>couples to renew not only their I600/I600A and fingerprints but their I171 as well <br/>sometimes up to three times.  <br/>The costs for these fees are not calculated within your adoption fees and therefore <br/>must be paid each time out of pocket by the adopting couple.  This can result in <br/>thousands of additional dollars spent, out of pocket, by the couple that has to <br/>process these forms/fingerprints up to three times before their adoption in finalized.<br/>Adoption is done for many reasons, mostly because loving people want a <br/>child/children and are willing and able to open their homes and hearts to children <br/>that would not otherwise have such opportunities and loving families to provide for <br/>them.<br/>Please rethink the issue of raising such fees as it will make it even more <br/>financially difficult for adoptive families to begin and complete their adoption <br/>process.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219db0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:36:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:30:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80219db0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1663/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1663/attachments"}}}}}
