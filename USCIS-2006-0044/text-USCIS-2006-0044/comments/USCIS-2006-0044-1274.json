The same is true for software. Moreover there has never been as <br/>much free open source software available. Why should the government be an <br/>exception?<br/><br/>Secondly, significantly increasing fees for legal immigration will only re-enforce <br/>illegal immigration. Most legal immigrants run up a bill of tens of thousands of <br/>dollars related to their paperwork and legal fees already. Who could still afford to <br/>legally migrate if this is increased with 66%?<br/><br/>Finally, USCIS already tagged on quite a bit of fees after 9/11 to fit the bill for <br/>increased screening, etc., Where did that money go?<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480213785", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-14T14:07:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-14T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-13T23:19:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80213785", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1274/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1274/attachments"}}}}}
