I am the new wife <br/>of an Indian National. He comes from Purulia, West Bengal. He could not afford <br/>these application fees without the help of myself and our friends. You must <br/>understand that even at the current fee level you are preventing the &quot;average&quot; <br/>income immigrant from entering the US. My husband is a hard worker and makes <br/>reasonable wages for India, but by our standards, it is almost nothing.  I <br/>understand not wanting immigrants arriving that would live off of welfare, but do <br/>you really think it is right to only allow the very wealthy into our country?  <br/>I agree it is appalling how slow and backward our current system is, but surely we <br/>can find another way of funding this department other than penalizing the would be <br/>immigrant. I write this while waiting for our application to be processed. He is in <br/>India and I am here. They are telling us it will be close to June before we can see <br/>each other again. I pray that, somehow, it can be processed sooner so we can <br/>begin our new life together. <br/>Most Sincerely,<br/>The new Mrs. Kashyap<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fa338", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-05T16:30:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-03T21:39:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Rep.
