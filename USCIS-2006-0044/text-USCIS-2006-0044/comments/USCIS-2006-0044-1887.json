It is <br/>already questionable that a person who is trying to adopt an orphaned child must <br/>re-file with the USCIS if their file becomes older than 12 months during the <br/>adoption process.  With the time-frames ever increasing and the average adoption <br/>placement taking nearly 18-24 months, the USCIS is almost in every case <br/>receving the full fees for adoption related petitions twice.  If you feel you must <br/>raise these fees in order to remain constant with inflation, then you need to help <br/>those of us that are already spending exhorbiant amounts of our hard-earned <br/>money to give an orphaned child a home by extending the length that our adoption-<br/>related petitions remain active to 24 months, or at the very least, reduce the cost <br/>of filing a second time.    <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a94d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:58:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T18:52:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sally Bromenshenk", "trackingNbr": "8021a94d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1887/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1887/attachments"}}}}}
