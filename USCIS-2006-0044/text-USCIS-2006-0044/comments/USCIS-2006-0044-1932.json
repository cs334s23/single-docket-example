Increasing the adoption fees will make it <br/>more difficult for aspiring middle-class parents to provide a loving home for children <br/>in need.  At a time when the eroding international reputation of the United States <br/>is feeding the flames of the terrorism that we seek to conquer, it makes no sense <br/>to make it more difficult for Americans to play a positive role in the international <br/>community.<br/><br/>Moreover, it is hard to imagine that the proposed increases, multiplied by the <br/>number of international adoptions, will have a significant impact on the budget.  <br/>How ironic that we continue to spend billions  on controlling the damage that the <br/>debacle in Iraq has wrought upon our reputation, while at the same time nickel <br/>and diming adoptive parents of foreign children.  These people have the potential <br/>to be a positive force for good in the world, and they are already bearing a <br/>substantial financial burden.  The total cost for a foreign adoption can be $20,000-<br/>$30,000.  <br/><br/>Foreign adoptions are consistent with the traditional role of America as country <br/>that provides a helping hand to those in need.  This is precisely the sort of activity <br/>that we should be encouraging.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab30", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:58:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T23:12:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Stephen M.
