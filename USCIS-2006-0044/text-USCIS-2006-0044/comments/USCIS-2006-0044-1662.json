Increasing prices are ok if the service itself is <br/>guaranteed to be better and faster.   But to have to wait 2 -3 months for a <br/>document to be returned seems to be by far too long when everything these days <br/>is electronic.  I believe if the fees need to be increased then the services should be <br/>up to par to the fees being asked.  This will be just one more thing to add to make <br/>adopting a child in need even harder.
