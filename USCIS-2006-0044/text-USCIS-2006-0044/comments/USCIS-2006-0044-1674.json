These families, my wife and I included, are <br/>trying to do the ethical thing and provide loving, caring homes to orphans from <br/>other countries.  We are required to disclose information, take lengthy medical <br/>tests, and send a lot of money to become parents.  The current procedure of the I-<br/>600a to I-171H is not only expensive, but it expires before we can use it. So now <br/>we have to submit this application twice during the adoption process, doubling our <br/>expense and wasting our time.  The whole process should be eliminated or at <br/>least be given without expiration.  We have to get these documents to apply and <br/>the recieve the child.  Its too much.  Please, please, please help those of us who <br/>open our hearts, homes, and checkbooks to share our way of life with a child that <br/>would not gain such access.  Don&#39;t nickel and dime these wonderful people who <br/>just want to start or expand their families.  We as a country are better than this.  <br/>Sincerely, Benjamin Carey<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219de8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:37:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:48:22Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Rep.
