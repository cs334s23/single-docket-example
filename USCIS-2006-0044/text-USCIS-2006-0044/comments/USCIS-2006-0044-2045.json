Americans are <br/>generous people. Many, many more Americans would adopt if it were only affordable. With an <br/>overseas adoption we can offer opportunities and hope that simply is unavailable to these orphans <br/>any other way. The point should be getting the children placed into loving homes. Many families <br/>can afford to RAISE a child, they cannot afford to ADOPT a child. It&#39;s time for governments, both <br/>here and abroad, to stop getting in the way of this important, deep, and deeply humane process. <br/>Help by not only keeping fees steady, but dropping them in order to enable more <br/>Americans to reach out with their hands, their hearts and their lives.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b76b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:27:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T22:19:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Liz Rosenberg", "trackingNbr": "8021b76b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2045/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2045/attachments"}}}}}
