Adoption is a very <br/>expensive task where even a simple increase can hurt a family&#39;s chances of <br/>completing the process.  <br/><br/>The proposed changes include:<br/>1.) Biometrics (fingerprints) from $70 to $80 per person, and <br/>2.) the I-600A from $545 to $670. <br/><br/>While this may not seem like much money to USCIS, when taken into account <br/>with fee increases by local and state government offices, adoption agencies and <br/>foreign governments, it all adds up!  My husband and I are looking at another <br/>$1000 in fees due this Fall simply because our paperwork is expiring and costs <br/>are rising across the board.  We can&#39;t control anything in this process from <br/>infertility to other countries&#39; policies on adopting to the cost of an adoption.  We <br/>can&#39;t even control whether a domestic birthmother selects us for a US adoption or <br/>whether the foster care system will deem it TODAY that they call us back about <br/>wanting to adopt.  We are at the mercy of everyone else in our quest to become <br/>parents.<br/><br/>It would be nice if one component of this process could side with the adoptive <br/>parent.,..could think for just a moment what the impact would be on us!  It would <br/>be wonderful if that one agency was USCIS.<br/><br/>Send a message to the world that USCIS values adoption!  That children deserve <br/>homes and that Americans welcome these children.  Help us start our family.  <br/>Don&#39;t create additional roadblocks to it.  There are enough already.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020779b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:52:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T15:51:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sheila Boyd", "trackingNbr": "8020779b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0463/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0463/attachments"}}}}}
