My husband and I are in the process of adopting our 2nd <br/>daughter from China.  We have already paid the fees once to immigration for our I-<br/>600A and fingerprints for this adoption.  The wait for China adoptions continues to <br/>lengthen, and the cost for international adoption is very high!  You should not be <br/>increasing these fees for pre-adoptive families as we already pay enough!  In fact, <br/>the immigration dept. should consider lengthening the validity timeframe of our I-<br/>171H&#39;s.  We can not help the fact that it is taking so long to adopt from China.  <br/>This additional proposed increase in fees is outrageous.  With all the money that <br/>is spent on the Iraq war, there is no reason why adoptive families should have to <br/>pay more money to immigration!<br/><br/>STOP MAKING THIS A POLITICAL GAME!!!  GET SENSIBLE~USE THE MONEY <br/>YOU ALREADY HAVE WISELY AND QUIT EXPECTING MIDDLE INCOME <br/>FAMILIES TO SPEND MORE!!  WE ARE TRYING TO ABANDONED CHILDREN <br/>FROM CHINA HAVE LOVING HOMES!!! MORE AND MORE FAMILIES CAN&#39;T <br/>AFFORD TO DO THIS IF YOU CONTINUE TO INCREASE FEES!!!<br/><br/>Also,  fee increase was not last done in 1998.  It was more recent than that.  I <br/>know this because we had to pay twice back in 2001 &amp; 2002 when we adopted <br/>the 1st time.  Everytime, we apply to USCIS for adoption, the fees continues to go <br/>up.  QUIT INCREASING THE FEES!!!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a4e3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T20:18:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T19:56:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Mary Ellen Lederer", "trackingNbr": "8020a4e3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0774/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0774/attachments"}}}}}
