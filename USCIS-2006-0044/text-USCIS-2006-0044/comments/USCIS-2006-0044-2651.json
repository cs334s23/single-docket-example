The <br/>wait has grown substantially since we first applied for our I600A in November of <br/>2005.<br/><br/>Now, that our paperwork is about to expire, we need to reapply for the I600A, redo <br/>our homestudy, and again pay the USCIS for these services.<br/>None of our family information has changed.  Our financial status is the same, our <br/>home location is the same and our fingerprints are the same.<br/><br/>The proposed fee increase is just another strain on many families like ourselves, <br/>who are trapped in this waiting process.<br/><br/>Please consider an extension to the I171H, and if not, please grant families, like <br/>ours, a separate extension fee or reduced rate.<br/><br/>The money saved could be put toward our child&#39;s adoption.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e3cc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:35:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T16:15:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Trudi and Reno Ciccotta", "trackingNbr": "8021e3cc", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2651/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2651/attachments"}}}}}
