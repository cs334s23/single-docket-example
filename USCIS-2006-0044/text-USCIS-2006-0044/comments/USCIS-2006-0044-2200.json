I just don&#39;t see how this is fair when the families that are adopting are <br/>already out a large amount of money due to there being no financial assitance for <br/>most families that adopt.  Yes, adoption is a choice but in one way we are already <br/>penalized due to insurance and employers not recongnizing adoption as a need <br/>like being in the hospital and giving birth to a baby.  Please reconsider keeping the <br/>fees as they are.  After a pregnant lady gives birth with her employer she is <br/>allowed at least six weeks of paid time at home to bond with the baby adoptive <br/>families are not extended this same kindness.  The adoptive families have to burn <br/>all vacation and sick time when we need this same time to bond with our babies <br/>just the same.  So any money that we can save on fees can most definitely be <br/>used after we are home to allow us to stay at home for a few extra days with our <br/>babies.  Thanks for listening and please please consider leaving the fees as they <br/>are.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021bdf9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T02:32:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T13:48:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Marty & Tammy Mask", "trackingNbr": "8021bdf9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2200/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2200/attachments"}}}}}
