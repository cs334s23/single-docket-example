The federal<br/>government has demonstrated a preference for adoptions, i.e., by supporting a<br/>tax credit.  This fee erodes that support by requiring that part of the credited<br/>fees be paid right back to the federal government in the form of processing<br/>fees. USCIS needs to increase its funding, since the waits for processing of<br/>fingerprints and home studies in some parts of the country are abominable. <br/>However, it should not increase its funding on the backs of the adoptive parents<br/>who are already being prohibitively charged for adoption related costs, and who<br/>are helping our country and other nations reduce governmental costs spent on<br/>orphans.  USCIS should find another way to locate financial support.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021acee", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:26:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T03:31:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sherry M.
