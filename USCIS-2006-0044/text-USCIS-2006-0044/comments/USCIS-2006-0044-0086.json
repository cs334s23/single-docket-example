To fund the DHS on application fees is too onerous on the immigrant<br/>population--it is simply not fair.  There are a lot of things UNAMERICAN in the<br/>tripled fee increase--and that is very sad...for the whole country.   <br/>  <br/><br/>    <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9a7d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:31:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T02:08:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Christina H.
