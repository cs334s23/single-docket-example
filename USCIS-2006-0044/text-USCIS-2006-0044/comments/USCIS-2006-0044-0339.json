Many are in search <br/>for economic and educational opportunities, due to economic turmoil or minimal <br/>educational opportunities in their homeland. I believe that immigrants who are <br/>predominantly in a higher economic bracket constitute an extremely small percentage <br/>of the applicants. The drastic increase would prove to be an obstacle for the less <br/>fortunate who wish to provide a better life for their families. Many who belong to this <br/>class do not all have the means to acquire the appropriate funds for the application <br/>fees for their entire family yet an increase would make it that much more difficult. <br/>Sacrifices are made to secure one family member&#39;s trip to the United States yet the <br/>burden becomes more difficult when fees increase. This increase would also deter <br/>legal entrance into the US. It would be economically feasible, though not legal, for <br/>many to cross the border undetected than pay the higher fee and wait years for a visa. <br/>This difference in increase represents the livelihood for a family who makes a fraction <br/>of a minimum wage worker here in the US.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020443a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-13T14:09:19Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-13T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-13T12:17:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jeffrey Gallego", "trackingNbr": "8020443a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0339/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0339/attachments"}}}}}
