The fees are already <br/>high enough and hard enough to pay for most of the immigrants that are in the <br/>U.S.A now. My vote would be to leave the prices as they are. We should help the <br/>people who are here, not deport them and make things harder for them than they <br/>already are. Most immigrants or aliens who come to the U.S. come to &quot;The Land <br/>of the Free&quot; and to get help and help support their families. The U.S.A has a good <br/>government system in helping people in need, such as W.I.C program and Food <br/>stamps, Medical, etc., in most other countries they don&#39;t have any help, and that <br/>is why so many are coming to the U.S.A.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020aefb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-23T21:11:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-23T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-23T21:04:44Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Nicole", "trackingNbr": "8020aefb", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0910/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0910/attachments"}}}}}
