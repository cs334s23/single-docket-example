The people who are reaching out to help children with no <br/>hope are being penalized for some reason by an unnecessary government tax.  All <br/>we&#39;re talking about is a little paperwork and database files.  Please reconsider a <br/>request to keep the adoptions fees where they are and look for other places to find <br/>additional revenue.  We are U.S. citizens, and we come from a long line of <br/>entrepreneural thinkers.  If you need help brainstorming other ways, please don&#39;t <br/>hesitate to contact me.  I would love to serve my country in a way that doesn&#39;t <br/>prohibit a child from having a mom or dad.  <br/><br/>Thanks for your time.<br/><br/>Andy Braner<br/>President Kanakuk Colorado<br/>andy@kanakuk.com<br/>417-331-2022<br/>www.kanakuk.com<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021be8a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T02:32:19Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T14:24:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Andrew Braner", "trackingNbr": "8021be8a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2202/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2202/attachments"}}}}}
