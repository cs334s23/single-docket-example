And I am in the <br/>process again to adopt a sibling for him.  The proposed USCIS fee increase on <br/>docket USCIS-2006- 0044 really puts a strain on adoptive parents.  The process to <br/>adopt internationally is very expensive, difficult and time consuming.  The fees <br/>already paid to USCIS are high enough.  Many families are looking at a long <br/>process ahead and the possibility of having to renew fingerprints and pay the fees <br/>again for the same adoption.  Not only should the fees not increase, but the length <br/>of time the 171H is valid should be lengthened.  <br/>Please consider that most of the families adopting are stretched to the limit <br/>financially to bring their children home and keep fees more reasonable for everyone.<br/>Thank you so much for your consideration.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219d5a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:35:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T18:53:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Melynda J Miller", "trackingNbr": "80219d5a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1655/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1655/attachments"}}}}}
