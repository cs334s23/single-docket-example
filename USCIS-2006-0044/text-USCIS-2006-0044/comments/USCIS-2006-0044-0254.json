Unless USCIS can get rid of five-year long backlogs and expedite <br/>application processing, raising the fees for various application categories will <br/>further undermine the reputation (or at this point simply the lack of reputation and <br/>inefficiency) of this government agency.  <br/><br/>Moreover, in a global market where competition for talent is fierce, the United <br/>States is certainly not going to be able to compete for the best with these fee <br/>increases without a corresponding increase in the time it takes to process an <br/>application.  USCIS is viewed as a dismal failure in terms of its service quality and <br/>responsiveness.  Raising the fee is only going to make this agency look like a <br/>bureaucracy that is doing nothing and making money!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fdb0a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-08T19:32:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-08T19:04:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801fdb0a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0254/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0254/attachments"}}}}}
