Part of the reason is the expense.  <br/>We had to take out a second mortgage and cash out our retirement accounts to <br/>bring out twin sons home from Korea in 2005.  <br/><br/>Why add expenses (an average of 66% in increases) in fees to this degree?  I <br/>believe that this will be a huge burden to families who simply want to provide a <br/>loving, stable home to a child.  <br/><br/>I ask you to please reconsider these rate hikes that will affect so many honest, <br/>hard working American families.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e569", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:38:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T21:35:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Michelle Dowd", "trackingNbr": "8021e569", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2689/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2689/attachments"}}}}}
