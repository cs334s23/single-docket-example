I-600/600A, Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative<br/>2. N-565, Application for Replacement of Certificate of Citizenship <br/>3. N-600, Application for Certificate of Citizenship<br/>4. Biometric Services <br/><br/>As you know, the above petitions and services are required for U.S. citizens <br/>adopting foreign-born children and bringing them home to the United States.  <br/>These are often citizens who have already undergone tremendous financial and <br/>emotional strain to bring a child into their lives, and the proposed fee increases -- <br/>at an average of 66% -- only put the dream of parenthood that much further out of <br/>reach for Americans of low and middle incomes.  These citizens go to great <br/>lengths to secure the extensive funding necessary for adoption, and every increase <br/>in costs pushes adoption, and thus parenthood, beyond the realm of possibility for <br/>more families.  <br/><br/>Please do not increase fees for the above listed petitions and services, which <br/>would be to the detriment of hopeful, would-be parents. Thank you very much for <br/>your consideration.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e7af", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T05:25:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021e7af", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2731/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2731/attachments"}}}}}
