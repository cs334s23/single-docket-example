With the increased time it takes to adopt from foreign countries <br/>most parents have to apply twice.  We as adoptive parents are already dealing <br/>with huge costs.  Many parents have drained their savings trying fertility <br/>treatments.  Due to our government&#39;s inabiltiy to provide equitible health care and <br/>no insurance coverage these costs are completely out of pocket.  Next these <br/>financially drained families turn to adoption.  They then have to pay huge <br/>expenses with no governmental or personal insurance assistance.  Many do not <br/>adopt within country because of the deplorable adoptive laws in this country.  <br/>Please do not add to the stress and burden of these families by increasing the <br/>fees over 140%.  Please make a special concession for adoptive families.  These <br/>are people that merely want to make a family and by doing so help out some of <br/>the most vulnerable citizens of the world...orphaned children.  Thank you for your <br/>time and attention<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d373", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:16:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T20:27:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Bonnie Elozory", "trackingNbr": "8021d373", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2426/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2426/attachments"}}}}}
