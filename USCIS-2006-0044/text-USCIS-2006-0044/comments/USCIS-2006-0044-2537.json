Those wishing to adopt <br/>internationally already face a great financial burden. When considering to raise<br/>fees, I ask that you please think carefully if there may be another solution, such <br/>as eliminating the need to file the I-600/600A (Petition to Classify Orphan as an <br/>Immediate Relative) and having to get fingerprinted twice (or more for some having <br/>to wait longer for a child) by extending the validity of the I-171H (&quot;Notice of <br/>Favorable Determination Concerning Application for Advanced Processing <br/>of Orphan Petition&quot;). It would seem that by eliminating the need to refile and get <br/>refingerprinted would cut down on time and cost and could be a viable alternative <br/>to raising fees. <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dcc9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:21:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T16:32:22Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Erin Crowley", "trackingNbr": "8021dcc9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2537/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2537/attachments"}}}}}
