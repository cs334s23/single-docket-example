Due to all the delays, much of their <br/>paperwork has expired. Now they have to refile and pay all the fees over again. <br/>This is an expensive proposition as it is. Now they find that the fees are going to <br/>be increased by up to 66%. It seems to me that the fees were high enough to <br/>begin with. Plus they now have to pay them again. All they want to do is adopt a <br/>child that would otherwise be shunned in it&#39;s own country. Thay can&#39;t have a child <br/>of their own. They would give this child a good home. Now it looks as if our own <br/>government is trying to make this impossible for them. Please reconsider this <br/>proposal. All they want to do is what is right. Thank you for any consideration you <br/>can give this.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # ", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aab3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T02:51:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T21:38:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Charles W.
