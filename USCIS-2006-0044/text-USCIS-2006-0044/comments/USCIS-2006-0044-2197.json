This has a major impact of hard working <br/>lower middle class families that are in the process of International Adoption.  We <br/>should encourage helping the adoptive families bring home their children, not slap <br/>more fees on them.  The services, red tape and turn around times do not warrant <br/>increasing the fees.  I could understand if the service you provided were stellar and <br/>fast, for the most part many of your CIS departments are slow and service for a <br/>I161 approval is in excess of 90 days.  Much termoil for a family waiting to bring <br/>home a baby thats sitting in an orphange overseas.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021bdde", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T02:31:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T13:40:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kim Ortiz", "trackingNbr": "8021bdde", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2197/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2197/attachments"}}}}}
