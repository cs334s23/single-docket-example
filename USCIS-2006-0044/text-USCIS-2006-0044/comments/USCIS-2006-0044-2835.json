Families who are adopting are already frequently overextended <br/>financially, often borrowing money just to be able to give a child a home.  Many <br/>are already in debt because of having paid for failed fertility treatments which are <br/>not covered by insurance.  Asking them to shoulder even more expense to put a <br/>child in their empty arms is too painful to think about.  <br/>Most importantly, it could prevent children who need a home from being able to go <br/>to one, as the parent may deem the process unaffordable.  Please do not allow <br/>this to happen.<br/>Thank you very much for your consideration<br/>Alice Simmons<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021efc7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:53:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Alice Simmons", "trackingNbr": "8021efc7", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2835/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2835/attachments"}}}}}
