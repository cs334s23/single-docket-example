As an adoptive <br/>parent money is an issue and having already paid for something that will not and <br/>has not changed in unreasonalbe. Instead of increasing the fees extend the time <br/>frame of the I-171H to 24 months instead of 18. I see no reason to repeat and an <br/>increase in fees will only add to the stress of adoptive parents such as myself. <br/>Thank you for considering my view.
