This <br/>would raise the cost of international adoption by several hunderd dollars!  <br/>International adoption is already a very large financial commitment and this would <br/>make it more difficult for families that are considering adoption.  We are in the <br/>process of adoption and have had to submit the current fee twice as the time limit <br/>expired on our approval.  The expiration dates should be reviewed as well but that <br/>is another issue.  We feel this it is wrong to raise the fees as it may prohibit <br/>families from considering adoption.
