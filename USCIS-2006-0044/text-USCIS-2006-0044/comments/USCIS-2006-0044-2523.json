With the wait for referral from China moving from 6-8 months <br/>to over 18 months, we have already had to redo our fingerprints once and our <br/>I600A, so we have already had to pay double the initial fee.  Adoption is already an <br/>expensive endeavor and increasing the fees on the U.S. side of things is a <br/>deterent to families looking to adopt especially if they may have to renew these <br/>forms and fingerprints due to the long wait.<br/><br/>If you are seriously considering this increase, please consider extending the <br/>approval period once these forms are approved.  15 months for fingerprints and 18 <br/>months for I171H is too short especially if families have to reapply due to a longer <br/>process/wait.<br/><br/>On behalf of the thousands of families who adopt internationally every year, we <br/>would like to formally express our opposition to this increase in fees for adoption <br/>related documents.  Please do not raise these fees.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Mr &amp; Mrs Mathison<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dc06", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:20:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T14:11:42Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021dc06", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2523/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2523/attachments"}}}}}
