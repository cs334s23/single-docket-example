Your proposed fees<br/>would increase our costs to USCIS by $630 ($125 I600, $20 biometrics, $205 N600<br/>AND $280 because our child is HIV+ and requires a waiver).  If I felt you<br/>provided reasonably fast service, were accommodating and friendly, I could<br/>accept the increase.  However, because for both adoptions I&#39;ve had to ask for<br/>our Senators office to inquire about delays, had to take time off work and drive<br/>4 hours for fingerprinting AND will now have to wait 3 months or more for our<br/>I601 waiver to be approved (while our child remains in an orphanage untreated<br/>for HIV), I cannot support your increases.  Please think twice before causing<br/>more pain to adoptive families.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c5f6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:57:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T00:44:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sherry", "trackingNbr": "8021c5f6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2251/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2251/attachments"}}}}}
