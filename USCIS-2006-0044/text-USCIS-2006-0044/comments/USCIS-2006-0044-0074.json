The fee increase will greatly affect so many that are already struggling <br/>to make it in this country. It is unfortunate that so many barriers are placed on <br/>those who are genuine about making this country great. I am a permanent resident <br/>and a low-income college student. Given the alarming increase in costs to attend <br/>a &quot;public&quot; university and the inavailability of financial aid, I struggle to pay my <br/>tuition every quarter and face the uncertainty of finishing my college degree. I want <br/>to become a citizen, but now it is ever more difficult. An increase in the fees would <br/>have me facing a harsh dilemma. I can either pay for school and not become a <br/>U.S. Citizen, or I can &quot;drop-out&quot; of school temporarily and apply to be naturalized. <br/>Please take into consideration students like myself and so many others who do <br/>not share the priviliges I have as a college student. I hope this proposal is haulted <br/>immediately. Thank you for your time and consideration. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9a02", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:09:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T00:07:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Elizabeth Cortez", "trackingNbr": "801f9a02", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0074/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0074/attachments"}}}}}
