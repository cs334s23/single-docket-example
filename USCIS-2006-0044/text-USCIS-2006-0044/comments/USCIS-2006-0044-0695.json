My daily efforts largely involve <br/>helping poor immigrant families with their immigration problems, and I assist <br/>hundreds every year.  Often, I am not paid for the assistance I render.  Those <br/>impacted the most by the fees proposed by Homeland Security will be the <br/>poorest.  To highlight one class, nearly every battered spouse that I&#39;ve ever <br/>assisted has been the victim of despicable violence and is typically barely able to <br/>make ends meet.  Ironically, they are usually the ones left to raise the children <br/>without the help of the abuser.  Nevertheless, the proposal offered by the <br/>government reasons that a 95% increase in fees on this particular class of people <br/>is warranted.  <br/><br/>In my experience, most families would prefer a delay in processing rather than <br/>pay such exorbitant amounts of money, which is literally &#39;hard-earned&#39;.  This <br/>proposed increase is excessive and I strongly urge Congress not to accept it.   <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802092b4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:44:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-17T00:04:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Richard B.
