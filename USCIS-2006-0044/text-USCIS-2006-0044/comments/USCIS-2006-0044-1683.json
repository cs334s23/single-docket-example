As I am <br/>certain you are aware, international adoption is an expensive and time consuming <br/>process.  This sort of drastic fee increase seems disproportionate.  While cost to <br/>the applicant may not seem a sufficient cause for objection, consider the resulting <br/>attendent consequences.  It is respectfully submitted that adoptions (both <br/>international and domestic) are something to be encouraged.  Our country&#39;s <br/>willingness to open its arms to orphans from all countries and ideologies is among <br/>our traits to be most admired.  Considering that many families sacrifice nearly to <br/>the breaking point in order to be able to pursue that option, any measure which <br/>drastically increases the fees associated with adotion should be rejected.  To the <br/>extent that fee increases are required, they should be implemented on a more <br/>reasonably adjusted basis -- e.g., 5% or even 10% per year -- so that they could <br/>be more easily handled by the financially taxed applicants.  As an additional <br/>matter, it seems particularly ironic during the current immigration debate to adopt <br/>a new set of fees that makes it much more difficult for those of us pursuing a form <br/>of legal immigration -- i.e., international adoption.  While I intend to pursue this <br/>option regardless, I do not want to see it closed off to other families.  Thank you <br/>for your consideration of these objections.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e28", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:01:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Lee D.
