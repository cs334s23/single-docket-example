Not only is it disappointing that the fingerprints and <br/>I171H expire so quickly (15 -18 months), requiring all waiting (China) adoptive <br/>parents to re-file, but to have to pay the increased fees is unreasonable.  The <br/>USCIS states that adoption is their highest priority, but I assure you that is not felt <br/>in the adoption community.  Long waits, high fees, and short shelf-lives are all <br/>valid complaints for those of us in the international adoption community.  Please <br/>do not raise your fees!<br/>Marcy Dunaway<br/>a waiting adoptive parent<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a94c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-23T19:00:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-23T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-22T18:45:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Marcy J.
