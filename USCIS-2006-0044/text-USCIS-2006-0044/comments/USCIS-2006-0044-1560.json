We <br/>needed to fill this form out for our upcoming adoption through China.  We have <br/>already paid the $545, and have recently found out that our wait time before we go <br/>to China to pick up our baby has been extended to another 18 months.  We <br/>started the adoption process in March of 2006.  So we will have to re-file the I 171-<br/>H, which also means the I-600A form, because it expires after 18 months, and this <br/>has to be current before traveling to China.  It is hard enough that we will have to re-<br/>file this form and pay the amount again, but now with the expense possibly going <br/>up to $670, this is going to be a huge heartache for us.  We are unable to have <br/>kids of our own, and would not be able to afford the adoption itself without the help <br/>we&#39;ve gotten from family.  We cannot afford another extra expense.  Please <br/>reconsider raising this fee, at least reconsider raising the fee by the amount that <br/>was being negotiated.  I really appreciate your time.  Thank you. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021796d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-21T20:33:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-21T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-21T19:16:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "CCAI (Chinese Children Adoption International)", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Sharene N.
