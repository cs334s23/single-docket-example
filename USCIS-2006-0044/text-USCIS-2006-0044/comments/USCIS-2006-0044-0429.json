Due to the inefficiency of Government <br/>departments my labor certification took more than 4 years and now my I140 <br/>application is pending over seven months. All these years my employer had to pay <br/>hefty fees for my H1B renewal and also H4 renewal for my family. Now, USCIS is <br/>proposing fee increase without providing any solution for the current immigration <br/>mess. During this period, I can not change employer or get promotion. The US <br/>immigration rules have made us &quot;Human Slaves&quot;. I pay taxes at the same rate as <br/>any other US citizen, but some benefits are denied to me because of my <br/>immigration status. This is already causing mental and financial prolems. In <br/>addition, this proposed fee increase will add extra burden to me without any real <br/>benefit.<br/><br/>So I strongly oppose this fee increase.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206c1f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T01:28:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T01:51:32Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80206c1f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0429/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0429/attachments"}}}}}
