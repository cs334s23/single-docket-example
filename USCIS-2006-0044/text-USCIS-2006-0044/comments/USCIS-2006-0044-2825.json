Why are fees going up this <br/>much?  I can understand if they were to rise along with the cost of living, but why <br/>punish those people who want to come to the US legally or those who live here and <br/>chose international adoption as the method to have a family?  All this does is make it <br/>hard for people like me, who as a college student, met and fell in love with an <br/>international student.  We were married right after graduation and have been married <br/>for 8 years.  With these increases, how would we have afforded all of the (then INS) <br/>forms, as recent college graduates.  We have chosed to have a family via international <br/>adoption.  While we both work and are contributing members of society, we are middle <br/>class and adoption is already expensive.  <br/><br/>Please do not make it even more expensive for people to come to the US legally.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef7c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:27:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kelly Keane-Grundell", "trackingNbr": "8021ef7c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2825/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2825/attachments"}}}}}
