The process for adoption is front loaded <br/>with costs which does impact individuals going through the process and will begin <br/>to tip the scales to less diverse individuals being able to support adoption overall. <br/>It is especially important where the processing time for the first time for <br/>fingerprints and the I171H may take longer than the document is valid for which <br/>then would present a second dose of the proposed increased fees to be paid. This <br/>is unacceptable. What benefits are being supported regarding these increased <br/>fees?
