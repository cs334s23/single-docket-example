Not only are the fees paid a second <br/>time, but all of the time and paperwork involved to reacquire necessary documents <br/>and update the homestudy are truly burdensome and unnecessary - particularly <br/>when fingerprints don&#39;t actually expire!<br/><br/>Before raising fees across the board - please think this process through to the end <br/>and make some allowances for people trying to adopt internationally.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a04b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:14:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-20T21:36:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted Kim A.
