These forms are used in international <br/>adoptions.  As you are probably already aware, adoption is a very expensive <br/>process.  As a prospective single adoptive parent, the burden of ever increasing <br/>fees could prevent me from pursuing this dream.  The length of time it takes <br/>between submitting paperwork for an adoption and actually receiving information <br/>on an available child is ever increasing, while the time that these documents are <br/>valid is finite.  In my opinion, it is unconscionable to request a 66% increase in <br/>these fees, while most families in this process are already looking at having to <br/>pay these fees TWICE due to the forms expiring before a child&#39;s referral is <br/>received by the adoptive family.  Most families, while they want a child more than <br/>anything in the world, must struggle to pay the existing fees as it is.  At the very <br/>least, there should be some sort of compromise in this process.  Perhaps <br/>increase the fees by half of the proposed amount, while increasing the amount of <br/>time that these forms and fingerprints are valid.  Or go ahead with the proposed <br/>increase, but significantly extend the amount of time that the forms and <br/>fingerprints are valid so that the likelihood of having to pay them twice is <br/>diminished.<br/>Adoption is a very difficult and expensive process as it is.  Please do not consider <br/>raising these fees without helping families, in some other way (i.e. extending the <br/>validity of the approvals), to pursue this option to build a family.<br/>Thank you for your time.<br/>Jami Andre&#39;<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219df6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:37:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:51:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jami L.
