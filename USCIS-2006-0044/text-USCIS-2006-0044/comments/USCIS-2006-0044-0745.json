Since the wait time has increased <br/>and is predicted to exceed the 18 months that the I171H for is valid for; we will <br/>have to refile that as well as the I600A form. We will have to pay the current fees <br/>all over again and if the fee increases we will have to do that as well. We want to <br/>give a loving home to a child that is otherwise unwanted and this increase in fees <br/>makes a already difficult process even harder; not to mention a finincial strain. <br/>Please help bring together our family by bringing home our daughter in the most <br/>efficient and practical way.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802095fe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:48:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-20T00:15:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Danyelle Leentjes", "trackingNbr": "802095fe", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0745/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0745/attachments"}}}}}
