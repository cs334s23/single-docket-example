With tha <br/>long wait ahead of us we realize we will have to go through it again &amp; pay all the <br/>fees once again. I plead with you NOT to increase fees.I cant stress to you <br/>enough the effect this would have on so many people and MOST IMPORTANTLY <br/>the children we yearn to bring home.
