We respectfully submit that you <br/>hold the fees steady so that this doesn&#39;t negatively impact others. As is, families <br/>wishing to adopt from China are already having longer and longer wait times and <br/>will need to re-apply for a I-171H. In our case, we will need to pay this fee twice, <br/>and at a higher rate if you raise these fees.<br/>Please take into account that this will impact thousands of potential American <br/>citizens wishing to adopt abroad. We already sacrifice so much to have children, <br/>and raising these already expensive fees will be more of a hardship and <br/>heartache. <br/>Robert and Jenny Gordon<br/>Macon, Georgia<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208016", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T21:07:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T02:41:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Robert and Jenny Gordon", "trackingNbr": "80208016", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0551/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0551/attachments"}}}}}
