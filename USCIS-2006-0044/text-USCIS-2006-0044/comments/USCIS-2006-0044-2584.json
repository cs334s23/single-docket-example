I feel adoptive parents <br/>should not be penalized ot have to pay a fee a second time, especially such a <br/>high fee. This is unreasonable and I would like to ask that this fee be lowered, or <br/>even better, eliminated.<br/>Thank you<br/>Valerie Conlan, R.N.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de7f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T21:28:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Valerie Conlan", "trackingNbr": "8021de7f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2584/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2584/attachments"}}}}}
