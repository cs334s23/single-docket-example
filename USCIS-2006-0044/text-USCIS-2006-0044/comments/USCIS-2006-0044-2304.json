McFatridge-I received word of a potential increase in <br/>fees for USCIS. I&#39;m writing to you to take exception to those of us who are waiting <br/>for adoption.  Even if you do need to assess fees, there should be a renewal type <br/>option of a lesser amount for those of us who have already filed at the initial full <br/>cost.  This whole process is out of our control.  With adoptions in China <br/>approaching 18 months for referral, it is inevitable that we will have to re-file.  All of <br/>these fees add up and I simply think it is unfair to assess a full-cost fee to a <br/>family that is simply waiting for their referral.  <br/><br/>The other option would be to allow us to renew our initial filing.  In today&#39;s adoption <br/>world, 18 months just isn&#39;t long enough.  <br/><br/>Thank you for reading my comments.  <br/><br/>Have a great day.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ce10", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:50:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T17:11:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jennifer McFatridge", "trackingNbr": "8021ce10", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2304/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2304/attachments"}}}}}
