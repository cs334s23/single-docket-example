We have adopted our <br/>daughter from China and the costs for international adoption are already so high <br/>that many potential adoptive parents that we know either go into significant debt, <br/>or have to entirely give up their dream of adopting a child.<br/>It is unconscionable to increase adoption related fees up to 66% - the process of <br/>adoption should not be used as an income stream for the government.  Please do <br/>not add another burden to the long list of expenses that adoptive parents have to <br/>shoulder.  Adoption is in the interest of both the children and families  so let&#39;s try <br/>to keep it affordable for as many families as possible.<br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c427", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:51:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T20:56:58Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Martin Cibulka", "trackingNbr": "8021c427", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2239/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2239/attachments"}}}}}
