As a parent hoping to adopt internationally, <br/>I am alarmed and deeply troubled by the severity of the proposed increases.  <br/>Incremental rate increases are expected and understandable, but with some fees <br/>more than doubling there is a terrible squeeze put on the charitable people who <br/>are already, in most cases, stretching the family budget to make a home for an <br/>orphaned child.  Adoption should not be limited to the wealthy, but those are the <br/>only families who will be able to afford these proposed fees without concern.  <br/>Please consider lowering the percentages by which these fees will be increased.  <br/>It would be intolerable if the adoption of even one child was compromised because <br/>a family could not afford the increases.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kara McKinzie<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021def0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:03:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T23:00:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kara McKenzie", "trackingNbr": "8021def0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2592/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2592/attachments"}}}}}
