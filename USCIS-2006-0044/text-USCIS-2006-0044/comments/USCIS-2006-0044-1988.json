An increase of 66% <br/>sows that there are potentially major problems in the processing of these <br/>applications and should be inspected instead of ignoring hte problem and passing <br/>the cost onto those people who are attempting to adopt and bring a new child into <br/>the United States for a happy life. I strongly oppose such a sharp increase in <br/>these fees. Please reconsider and inspect the need for this increase instead of <br/>just passing it onto the new parents just wanting to adopt a child.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Ryan Burke<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b51f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:12:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T17:46:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ryan Burke", "trackingNbr": "8021b51f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1988/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1988/attachments"}}}}}
