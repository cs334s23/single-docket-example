If you <br/>increase the fees for H1B &amp; I-485, it is going to hurt lot of small companies &amp; its <br/>employees due to additional financial burden.<br/>2) You are already charging additional $1000 for premium processing to expedite <br/>the petition, which is already being utilised by most of the applicants because <br/>they are not getting any thing done from the dept in a reasonable time with <br/>standard fees.<br/>3) I would accept the proposed fee hike if you eliminate the premium processing <br/>fee &amp; issue all the I-129,I-797,I-140&#39;s in 45 days without any excuses.<br/>4) I would also accept the proposed fee hike for I-485&#39;s if you reduce the <br/>processing time to 90 days .<br/>There should be some fiscal responsibility by the dept before hiking the fees to <br/>demonstrate that they are going to become more efficient by increasing the fees, <br/>and if that is not the case, fees should not be increased.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802039d5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-13T14:05:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-13T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-13T01:06:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "802039d5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0336/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0336/attachments"}}}}}
