I am especially concerned with the increase in fees <br/>for the I-600A and biometrics.  The I-171H is only valid for 18 months and <br/>biometrics are only valid for 15 months.  Most international adoptions are currently <br/>taking more than 18 months, hence, many adoptive families are having to pay <br/>these fees twice.  There is no opportunity to &quot;renew&quot; the I-171H or biometrics at a <br/>lower cost causing an increase in the financial burden of an international adoption.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b634", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:17:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T19:25:42Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Melinda McClard", "trackingNbr": "8021b634", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2013/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2013/attachments"}}}}}
