Keep in mind that most international <br/>adoptions can take up to two years to complete.  Therefore, we have to do this <br/>process twice.  We have to pay twice.  If you are going to up the fees, you need <br/>to extend the fingerprint expiration time AND the I797C approval time to 2 years.  <br/><br/>I can tell you waiting for the I797C approval from the Atlanta USCIS was the most <br/>frustrating experience we have had in the adoption process.  This office is slow <br/>and inefficient compared to other USCIS offices.  Why do some offices take only a <br/>few weeks to process while the Atlanta office this past summer was ovre 15 <br/>weeks to wait.<br/><br/>Extend the length of fingerprints and I797C!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207720", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:37:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T14:21:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jennifer A.
