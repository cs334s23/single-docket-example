To help us you need<br/>to make the I 600 A and fingerprints valid for at least 24 months, and to keep<br/>fees at a minimum, I understand the increase but not a 140% increase.<br/>Sincerely, Christine Birchfield<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e4a6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:37:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T19:17:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Christine Birchfield", "trackingNbr": "8021e4a6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2668/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2668/attachments"}}}}}
