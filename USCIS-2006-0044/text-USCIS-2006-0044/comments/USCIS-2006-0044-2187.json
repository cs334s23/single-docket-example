Our family is presently <br/>in the process of adopting our daughter from China. Due to the increasing waiting <br/>time, it is very probable that we will have to resubmit to USCIS since all our <br/>paperwork will expire. Adoption is a personal journey that every family makes <br/>requiring much emotional and financial sacrifices. It has been difficult enough <br/>covering all the fees required and yet because of the short time (12 month) of the I-<br/>600 and I-600A forms we will be paying it in the end twice. Please be considerate <br/>for the families that have chosen to do a good thing in giving hope and life to an <br/>orphan. Please do not burden us with increased fees and find another way to <br/>adjust your budget. I sincerely hope and pray that you will reconsider and do not <br/>pass the proposed increase. Remember the adoptive families and the children <br/>they are bringing home. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021bace", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T01:40:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T12:13:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ana Mendez", "trackingNbr": "8021bace", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2187/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2187/attachments"}}}}}
