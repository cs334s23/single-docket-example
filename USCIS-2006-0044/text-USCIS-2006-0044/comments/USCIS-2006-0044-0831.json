She wants me to say that this is another step by the Government that<br/>makes it HARDER to adopt a child, both domestically and abroad.  However, part<br/>of the proposal says that you will decrease the backlog.  The most frustrating<br/>part of our adoption so far is the wait time involved in getting our approval on<br/>our fingerprints.  If you reduce this backlog, then I don&#39;t care about the fee<br/>increase.<br/><br/>I have talked with several people who have stated that their fingerprints were<br/>lost several times and scheduling is a joke, sometimes a month out from when you<br/>are sent the letter.  In my experience, money doesn&#39;t fix incompetence, so if<br/>you can get people processed in under a month and extend the expirations on<br/>fingerprints, go for the fee increase.  If not, you are just a bunch of<br/>bureaucrats asking for more money.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a83c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-23T18:58:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-23T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-22T15:16:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Maurice G.
