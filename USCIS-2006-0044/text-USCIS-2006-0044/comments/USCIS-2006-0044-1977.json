This will discourage some people from persuing adoption. <br/>When my husband and I decided to start a family, we wanted to adopt. Looking at <br/>the costs of adoption, we decided to try to have biological children. After persuing <br/>treatment that did not work, we decided that, instead of continuing with infertility <br/>treatments, we would put that money toward adopting. It took us years to save up <br/>enough money to finally bring our son home. We have not adopted again, although <br/>we truly want to in our hearts, because of the cost involved. There is no reason to <br/>continue to raise the costs of the paperwork required. As it was, we had to redo <br/>our fingerprints and our I 600 because they had &quot;expired,&quot; thus increasing our <br/>costs on an already tight budget. I feel the important thing to remember is to <br/>encourage people who want to expand their family by adoption, not add another <br/>element to discourage. Increasing the fees by about 66% is completely <br/>unreasonable. There should be no reason that the fees need to increase by such <br/>a dramatic number.  I would encourage you to streamline your paperwork <br/>processes, increase the &quot;expiration&quot; date, and look at combining what paperwork <br/>you require if you need to decrease the costs of processing such paperwork, and <br/>not to increase the fees.<br/>Thank you,<br/>Kelly Ryder <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b4c1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:11:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T16:51:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kelly D.
