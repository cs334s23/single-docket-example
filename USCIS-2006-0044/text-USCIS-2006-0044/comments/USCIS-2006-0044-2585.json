And, with the given that many parents<br/>must go through the process and pay fees TWICE while waiting for their dossier<br/>to be processed overseas these additional fees become even more obscene.  It<br/>becomes even more upsetting when you read that the increase in fees is to<br/>provide services to some asylum cases and others at no charge.  If the USCIS is<br/>in need of additional funding, then raise the fees for ONLY the ones attempting<br/>to immigrate here (not adopted minors).  And as for those who are provided<br/>services at no charge, if it is of benefit to all Americans then the cost should<br/>be paid by all Americans (i.e. funded through the federal budgeting process) not<br/>paid by the small percentage of Americans who happen to adopt an orphaned child<br/>form overseas.  This huge increase in fees by a governmental agency is uncalled<br/>for.  Especially in this time of the public demanding that government be held<br/>more accountable for the resources it has.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de8c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:08:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T21:38:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parents, Frank and Allyson Moore", "trackingNbr": "8021de8c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2585/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2585/attachments"}}}}}
