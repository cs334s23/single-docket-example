International adoption is expensive, given fees and monies<br/>for processing here in the U.S. as well as the processing in the country of our<br/>child&#39;s birth.  For us, the process has taken much longer than normal.  This has<br/>already meant extra fees be paid to CIS for a second set of fingerprints because<br/>they expired, as well as the fee for an expired I-600a.  While we understand<br/>labor costs for CIS would increase periodically, these increases proposed seem<br/>excessive.  We would ask for a much more modest increase in CIS fees, given the<br/>many devoted American families who are trying to bring a child into their homes.<br/> We hope that our little girl can have a little sister and would like to make<br/>that dream a reality too, without the barriers of excessive costs.   Thank you<br/>for listening and your consideration.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e751", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T03:42:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021e751", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2723/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2723/attachments"}}}}}
