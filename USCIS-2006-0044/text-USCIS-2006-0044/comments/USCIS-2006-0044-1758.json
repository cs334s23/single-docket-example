Adoption is so expensive already...At the same time, I <br/>would like to propose that the 18 month current expiration period for a I600-A form <br/>be lengthened....With the current wait times for adoption from China, my husband <br/>and I will have to re-apply, be re-fingerprinted and apply for a home study update. <br/>All of these fees will be close to another several thousand dollars.
