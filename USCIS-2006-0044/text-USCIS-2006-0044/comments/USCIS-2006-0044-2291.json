Many petitioners have to save up money for years before they can <br/>apply: to do so, they have to live in difficult conditions and are abused also. There <br/>have been many increases and none have taken into account the reality of being <br/>an immigrant in this country. Low paying jobs, discrimination, lack of proper <br/>education, low health literacy and the list could take many many pages are all <br/>challenges in our lives. The cost of life has increased for all, but immigrants suffer <br/>unecessarily more than any other, having to make it here and to support families <br/>in their countries as well.  <br/>Please reconsider this ADJUSTMENT!! It&#39;s harsh and unecssary! Although your <br/>proposal about making the USCIS more funtional is well written, why do we have <br/>to be the ones to pay for it all. All the country benefits for having immigrants: we <br/>work, pay takes, and contribute to the strenght of the ecomomy. Beside , pushing <br/>people into clandestinity is a poor form of fighting it and have never been proven <br/>efficient.<br/>Thank you<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cd56", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:03:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T15:44:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "NOT APPLICABLE", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Joyce Diop", "trackingNbr": "8021cd56", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2291/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2291/attachments"}}}}}
