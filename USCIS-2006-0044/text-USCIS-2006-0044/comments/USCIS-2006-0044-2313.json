The American taxpayers should not be <br/>expected to provide additional monies to support immigration.  The U.S. has a very <br/>liberal immigration policy, and those who wish to take advantage of it should be <br/>willing to pay for it.  It is a privilege; not a right.  The government is not raising fees <br/>in an attempt to make a profit; the government wants to cover its costs, and that is <br/>a reasonable thing to do.  Critics often complain about government inefficiency, but <br/>one problem is that funds are not available to update systems to the 21st century.  <br/>In addition, applicants and petitioners often file incomplete or inaccurate <br/>paperwork, resulting in additional processing costs.  Many applications are <br/>unnecessarily submitted through lawyers, who may charge high fees.  Customers <br/>can save money by submitting the paperwork themselves.  The U.S. government <br/>and taxpayers should not be expected to further subsidize immigration.  The fee <br/>increases are based on a thorough study.
