That means, no promotion, no <br/>substantial increase in salary. Imagine this for over six year or more. Trying to <br/>balance the family budget and paying more and more fees for &quot;immigration <br/>benefits,&quot; is a taxing financially and mentally.<br/><br/>With DOL clearing me to work and the Immigration petition to from my employer <br/>approved, why should my wait due to &#39;quotas&#39; actually translate to more fee. <br/><br/>I have filled my GC application for August 2002  and since there were some <br/>complications within the system, the processing of my application is taking about <br/>5 years. While this delay is not my fault, now I have to pay the consequences of <br/>increased fees. I think people who have filled their applications before April 2, <br/>2007, should pay at rates that existed at the time of the application, that way any <br/>delays in processing will not affect the applicants. <br/><br/>I STRONGLY OPPOSE this fee increase.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f0bc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:06:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T21:55:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Alexander Gerasimov", "trackingNbr": "8021f0bc", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2859/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2859/attachments"}}}}}
