The anticipated increase, which could be more <br/>than double the cost of some applications, will be too much for the people.  I think <br/>that it is like telling the people that if you can&#39;t afford the filing fee, you can&#39;t apply <br/>for immigration petitions/applications.  The increase is way too high, such as <br/>Form I-485, the proposed fee is $905.
