Biometrics (fingerprints) from $70 to $80 per person, and <br/>2.) the I-600A from $545 to $670. <br/><br/>We are currently waiting to adopt our child, but both our fingerprints and I-600A <br/>will probably expire before we receive our child.  We don&#39;t understand why we <br/>would have to re-submit our fingerprints and the I-600A when none of our <br/>information has changed.  Not only will we have to renew our fingerprints and I-<br/>600A, but now you are proposing to increase it as well?  Please don&#39;t do this to <br/>us!  We cannot afford to pay anymore money and we beg you not to increase <br/>these fees.<br/>Thank you for hearing us out.<br/>Andrea Mercado &amp; Paul Lentz, soon to be adoptive parents for the first time and <br/>hopefully save a child&#39;s life!<br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207dc5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T19:25:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T21:54:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Andrea Mercado", "trackingNbr": "80207dc5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0511/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0511/attachments"}}}}}
