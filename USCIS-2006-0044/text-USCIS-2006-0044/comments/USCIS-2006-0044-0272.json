Since then, the fees have <br/>increased dramatically, and so have processing times.  <br/><br/>The fees are already very high.  They put a burden on a person who is just asking for <br/>an adjudication under law.  The fees are high enough to be a financial burden on the <br/>middle class.  These raises in the fee bring the mere request for adjudication into a <br/>place where only the upper middle class has a chance to just ask for an adjudication.<br/><br/>In addition there are many deadlines, and poorer people may not be able to come up <br/>with the money in time, making it a matter of wealth as to whether or not one can <br/>simply ask for an adjudication.  <br/><br/>This burden falls on U.S. citizens.  They are the ones filing for their alien family <br/>member or employee.  A U.S. citizen has a right to marry the person of their choice, if <br/>they choose to marry an alien, the filing fees make a sort of penalty.  Filing fees should <br/>be just minor fees, not so high that they are a major factor in a person&#39;s budget.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801ff12d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-09T20:06:01Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-09T15:36:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Laraine A.
