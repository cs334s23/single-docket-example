We have been <br/>informed that this process will take longer than the 18 months allowed for our <br/>USCIS forms and fingerprints. Which means we will have to be refingerprinted and <br/>complete the forms again. This will be a very costly expense for our family and I <br/>am asking that the fees not be increased for the adoption portions of <br/>USCIS.Families already face significant expenses when adopting and this would <br/>be a hardship they should not have to incur! Our government needs to consider <br/>adoptive families and not raise the fees! <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cf52", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:50:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T18:58:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Amy", "trackingNbr": "8021cf52", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2409/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2409/attachments"}}}}}
