I am a single woman trying to do something <br/>good for the world by adopting an orphan from Central America-- the process has <br/>taken me almost 2 years and has cost over 25,000 so far-- with more expenses to <br/>come. The paperwork is daunting! Please keep the fees as they are-- they are <br/>very expensive all ready. Otherwise people who would make wonderful parents to <br/>children in need will be discouraged and unable to adopt with all its financial <br/>burdens.
