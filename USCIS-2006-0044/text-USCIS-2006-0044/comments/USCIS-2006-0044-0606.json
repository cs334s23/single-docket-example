However, I have two issues with<br/>the existing I-600 processing.  First, I do not understand why new fingerprints<br/>must be taken on a subsequent filings of the I-600.   The fingerprints are<br/>stored electronically and don&#39;t ever change.   Why must this process be<br/>reconducted after the first time, wasting both time and money?   Secondly, for<br/>those of us that must refile an I-600 petition because of delays in the host<br/>country adoption process, why must we pay the full processing fee again? If the<br/>circumstances of the adoptive parents have not changed, is there really a need<br/>to proceed like this is a brand new application rather than a simple<br/>&quot;continuation&quot; application? <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020805d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T18:25:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T03:19:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Erik Kjeldsen", "trackingNbr": "8020805d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0606/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0606/attachments"}}}}}
