Many adoptive parents are barely able to scrape together the costs <br/>to realize their dream of being a parent.  The increase in fees will increase costs to <br/>a process that already costs thousands of dollars!  I have spent almost $45,000 to <br/>adopt my daughter internationally and may now have to pay almost $400 to get a <br/>new Certificate of Citizenship due to a name change!  I already felt the current fee <br/>of $220 was awfully expensive just to get a new form with a different name...now to <br/>have to pay $380 is criminal and I have NO choice....it is an important document <br/>my daughter must have!  To those making the ultimate decision - consider how <br/>you would feel if you were in the shoes of we law abiding, tax paying, adoptive <br/>parents!  I submit you may feel similarly outraged and on the very short end of the <br/>stick!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cf4b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:50:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T18:55:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jennifer Raposo", "trackingNbr": "8021cf4b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2407/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2407/attachments"}}}}}
