My husband, Steve, and I are in the process of adopting a <br/>child from China.  We have tried for 10 years to conceive a baby and it has not <br/>happened even though every doctor says we should be fine.  This has been a <br/>difficult journey.  Therefore, we decided to adopt and we are very excited to adopt <br/>a little girl from China.  However, China has extended the wait time beyond the 18 <br/>months that our 171H form is valid.  We will have to re-file the I-600A form.   We <br/>will have to pay an additional $830.  When you adopt, it is a very costly endeavor <br/>that will be well worth the money.  However, it would help us if the fees for the I-<br/>600A were not increased and we only had to pay an additional $685.  <br/><br/>We are also pleading with the Judiciary committee to extend the validity of the <br/>171H from 18 months to 24 months.  To re-file is time consuming as well as <br/>expensive.  Please consider our plea to not increase the fees for the advanced <br/>processing petition for adoption of an orphan (I-600A form).  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in this matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Lisa and Steve Lenz<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480217c6f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-22T15:59:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-22T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-22T03:29:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Ron Klein", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Lisa A.
