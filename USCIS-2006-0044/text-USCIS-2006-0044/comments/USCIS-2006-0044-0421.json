The fact that we have to apply for an extension on our 171H due <br/>to the China delays is already going to add hundreds of dollars to the cost and, <br/>now, with refingerprinting and refiling increases, we will have to pay a lot more! <br/>Thanks for considering the financial hardships upon internationally adopting <br/>parents.
