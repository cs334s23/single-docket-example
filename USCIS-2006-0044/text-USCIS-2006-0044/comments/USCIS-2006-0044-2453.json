The current fees are <br/>already high and to raise them would severely hurt those people who wish to adopt internationally.  <br/>Not only would the initial fingerprinting be exhorbitant, but the fact that many adoptions take longer <br/>to complete means that parents have to go through the process twice, doubling the fees.  Please, <br/>please reconsider this fee increase or at least have the current fee remain in place for adoptive <br/>parents.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d7ea", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:18:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T00:31:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Colleen Vasey", "trackingNbr": "8021d7ea", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2453/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2453/attachments"}}}}}
