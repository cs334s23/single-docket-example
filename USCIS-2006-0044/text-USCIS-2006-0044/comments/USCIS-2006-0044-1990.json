These fee increases would create <br/>added financial stress on families wanting to adopt.  If a company increased their <br/>prices and fees by 66% in a year then that company would be out of business. <br/>My wife and I are adopting 4 children.  Thankfully we only had to submit <br/>paperwork to INS once, however we know couples that are 2 years into a 3 year <br/>process and they will have to submit again before completing the adoption <br/>process.  These fee increases are ridiculous.  For some couples the only option <br/>for having kids is to adopt.  Also with the difficulty and enormous red tape of <br/>domestic adoption their only alternative is international adoption.  There are <br/>couples that want to have children and want to be able to provide a good, loving <br/>home for those children.  There are children that are in desperate need of love, <br/>attention, and the opportunity to grow up in this type of environment. With the <br/>proposed fee increases these two groups may never meet.  It will build barriers <br/>that will prevent these two from coming together and forming a home.  Some <br/>couples that are considering adoption will get to these fees and decide to turn <br/>back and forgo the adoption process all together.  I urge you to reconsider and <br/>then shelve the proposed fee increases for the sake of the children needing good <br/>homes, and for the families that can provide those good homes.  You can make a <br/>difference with your decision.  Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>sincerely,<br/><br/>Shelby Luckel<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b52d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:12:21Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T17:58:08Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Shelby M.
