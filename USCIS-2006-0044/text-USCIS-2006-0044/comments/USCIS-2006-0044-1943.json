In fact, most of the <br/>families pursuing international adoption will have to renew their USCIS paperwork <br/>before the process is completed. This means the government is getting twice the <br/>amount of money. I do not see why the rate increase is needed or justified. The <br/>rates are already outrageous. In my opinion, it is unnecessary to charge $545 for <br/>a form and $70 for fingerprints. It would be even more outrageous to increase <br/>these rates. Once again, I ask that you reconsider this rate increase. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ab7f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T13:55:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T00:08:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021ab7f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1943/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1943/attachments"}}}}}
