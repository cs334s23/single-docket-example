We would urge the <br/>USCIS not to raise its fees for the biometrics and I-600A filings.  This proposed <br/>increase places a prohibitive cost on families adopting children internationally, <br/>many of whom are middle income families.  <br/><br/>The fact that we even need to refile our I-600A because it will expire due to the <br/>increased timeline of the adoptin process is ridiculous.  Add to that the increase <br/>in the fees is unfair and burdensome.  Funds that should be used to prepare our <br/>home for our child will now have to be diverted for payment of a second (and <br/>possibly higher) fee.  <br/><br/>As taxpayers and constituents of your agency, we would urge you to reject the <br/>increase in the biometrics and I-600A fees. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208cd8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:42:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T17:30:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Cathy Ziemba", "trackingNbr": "80208cd8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0675/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0675/attachments"}}}}}
