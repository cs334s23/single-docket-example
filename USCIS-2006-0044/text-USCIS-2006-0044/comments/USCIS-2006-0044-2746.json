As I am sure you <br/>are aware, the costs for adoption are rising both within and outside of the United <br/>States.  By rising, I mean rising at a rate in the 10 to 25% range per year.  The <br/>rate hikes proposed for the USCIS far exceed a reasonable amount in comparison <br/>to the rates of inflation or increases of income levels of adopting families.  While <br/>increases seem inevitable, reason must be used to determine the amount.  <br/><br/>I also want to remind legislators that our country relies on a growing economy, of <br/>which, immigration is one way that our population grows.  Legislation must <br/>consciously continue to encourage births, adoption &amp; legal immigration with the <br/>long range affect of more consumers &amp; a stronger economy.  It is simple <br/>economics.  Our tax and fee systems need to look at the big picture so that we <br/>have enough tax payers in the future.  Short term costs are just that...short term.  <br/><br/>Respectfully yours,<br/><br/>Andrea Loppnow<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ebf0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:42:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T13:32:59Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Andrea Loppnow", "trackingNbr": "8021ebf0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2746/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2746/attachments"}}}}}
