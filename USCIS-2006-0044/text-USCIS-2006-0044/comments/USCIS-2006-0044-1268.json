I&#39;m not against a raise in the fees to file in itself. However, I do not like the <br/>fact that because we are adopting from China and due to the lengthy wait to <br/>receive our child match, that I will have to refile the I-600A. I think it would be OK <br/>to raise the overall fee, but I don&#39;t think that should be done unless the timeframe <br/>until expiration is extended to a timeframe that takes into consideration the <br/>extended period of time to adopt from China, OR the fee to refile is significantly <br/>reduced. I have a hard time understanding why it costs the exact same amount to <br/>refile the same information, anyway.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Amy N Klopfenstein<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802135b6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-14T14:00:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-14T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-13T16:57:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Amy N.
