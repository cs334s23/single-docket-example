I understand there is a need for more money to finance the current <br/>working systems of CIS.  However the proposed fees are way too high for the <br/>working, poor and disabled immigrants to afford.  In my humble opinion increasing <br/>the fees will not make the processing of immigrantion applications  at CIS  go any <br/>faster.  How about increasing the fees to something lower and affordable?  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f97e0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T19:15:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T18:07:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By S.M.M.", "trackingNbr": "801f97e0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0019/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0019/attachments"}}}}}
