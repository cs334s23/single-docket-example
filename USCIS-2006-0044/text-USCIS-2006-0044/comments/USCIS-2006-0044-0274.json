Priority Dates are so far behind that it is taking close to 6 -8 years<br/>for one eligible skilled worker to get a permanant resident status. Our<br/>democratic govt doesnt want to provide any input on increasing the processing<br/>time for one to get his or her permanant status and want to increase fees in<br/>every sector.<br/><br/>In one way our government want more skilled workers to come to US and share<br/>their knowledge and expertise in short want to propose to increase the number of<br/>H1 B quota. Secondly they want to propose to increase the filing fees to get H1B<br/>visa making it much harder for companies to find a worker as the financial<br/>burden is going to worsen this process more than solving it. <br/><br/>Anonymous <br/>Houston Texas <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801ff3eb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-09T20:06:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-09T16:23:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801ff3eb", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0274/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0274/attachments"}}}}}
