My sister <br/>and her husband are trying to adopt their second child from China.  They have <br/>submitted all their paperwork.  It has been approved and they are only awaiting the <br/>referral.<br/><br/>It seems incredibly unfair to charge them again, essentially more than double, for <br/>nothing more than issuing them the same paperwork for work that has already <br/>been done.  Just because the Hague Treaty and the delay in processing by the <br/>county of adoption, does not make it right to charge them again for no added <br/>benefit.<br/><br/>My sister&#39;s family and hundreds of others are trying to do thing legally and above <br/>board.  The proposal as it is, is counterproductive and appears to be punishment <br/>for trying to do the right thing<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e077", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:05:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T04:16:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Robert Wilson", "trackingNbr": "8021e077", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2621/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2621/attachments"}}}}}
