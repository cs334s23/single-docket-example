Adoptions from foreign countries are expensive <br/>and tedious enough without the Federal Government increasing the out of pocket <br/>costs.  It seems that this proposal would mainly, if not exclusively, punish those <br/>who are trying to give others (legally) the opportunity to live in the greatest country <br/>on this planet.  We beg of you, do not raise the rates!  It is already bad enough <br/>that the USCIS forms and documents already obtained and fully paid for expire <br/>after 12 months, when very few adoptions take less than 12 months to complete.  <br/>Again we ask, DO NOT RAISE THE RATES!  Please stop the punishment of your <br/>best citizens!<br/><br/>Thank You<br/>Matt and Krista Conner <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c74f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:01:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T03:52:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Matt & Krista Conner", "trackingNbr": "8021c74f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2266/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2266/attachments"}}}}}
