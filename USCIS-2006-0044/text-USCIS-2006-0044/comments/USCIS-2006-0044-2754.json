As someone who has completed one <br/>international adoption and is working on my second I  can attest to the huge <br/>expenses associated with international adoptions both financially and emotionally. <br/>So many families of middle income are struggling to come up with all the stated <br/>and unstated fees from our agencies, the international country as well as current <br/>US Government expenses that a rise in these fees is going to put the dream of a <br/>family out of reach for so many. <br/><br/>There has to be a better way to obtain your needs than to take more and more <br/>from those already doing so much.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ec84", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T14:25:25Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T14:31:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lisa Castner", "trackingNbr": "8021ec84", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2754/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2754/attachments"}}}}}
