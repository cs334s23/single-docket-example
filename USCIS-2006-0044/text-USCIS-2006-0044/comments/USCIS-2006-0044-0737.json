In 2000 I began the paper work to <br/>adopt my daughter and the fees were considerably less than they are now.  Now I <br/>am in process of waiting the match of my second daughter and have already paid <br/>increased fees since the last adoption. While they may not be intended as such, <br/>increases on increases seem like a penalty levied of people like me who want to <br/>give a child in need a home, rather than add to the world?s population. <br/><br/>On top of it all, my I-171h is going to expire and I will need to shell out even more <br/>money for an updated home study, fingerprints and USCIS fees. In addition, the <br/>update requires another day out of work without pay for the USCIS appointment. <br/>The emotionally exhausting wait, paper trail, financial strain and now salt in the <br/>wounds increased fees only adds to what should be a hopeful and happy time in <br/>parenthood.<br/><br/>Raising children in this day and age is expensive enough. The increased cost of <br/>healthcare, fuel, education etc. is enough to worry about. As our government by <br/>the people and for the people, I respectfully plead for decreased USCIS fees s that <br/>will help EASE the financial burden of parenthood, not cripple it. <br/><br/>Hopefully,<br/><br/>Diane Dunleavy<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802095ae", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:48:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-19T19:38:08Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Diane C.
