The international adoption<br/>proceess is already a very expensive process.  Given the long timeframes<br/>required for those of us adopting from China, the possibility of needing to<br/>apply twice is very real.  Hence, it is doubly expensive for us to see a raise<br/>in your fees.  Please do not raise the fees until Congress authorizes an<br/>extension of the timeline on the I-600A/I-171H.  It would be fair if the rise in<br/>price coresponded with helping us NOT need to apply again.  It would save us<br/>money and it would save you, the department, resourses as you would not need to<br/>address the re-applications.  This would benefit both of us.<br/>Thank you for your concideration.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802114a3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T14:05:22Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-09T19:31:59Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Patrick", "trackingNbr": "802114a3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1173/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1173/attachments"}}}}}
