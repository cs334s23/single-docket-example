If this increase was a single occurance it would not seem <br/>extreme, but with most international adoptions taking longer than the time an <br/>I171H and fingerprints are valid most families would need to pay these fees two or <br/>more times.<br/><br/>Having to pay for processing of fingerprints and a second I600A is bad enough <br/>without adding the additional fees on top.<br/><br/>If this proposed change is adopted I would strongly suggest making changes to <br/>the number of months that adoption fingerprints and the I171H are valid to bring <br/>them more in line with referal wait times for international adoption.  It is a hard pill <br/>to swallow when this increased financial hardship is thrust upon adoptive families <br/>by the US directly caused by our US government itself.<br/><br/>If you have taken the time to read and consider my comments, I thank<br/>you deeply. My concern is much deeper than this, and I hope that you<br/>will not increase such fees, but if you do that the time to expiration will increase.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207719", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:37:21Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T14:14:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80207719", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0452/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0452/attachments"}}}}}
