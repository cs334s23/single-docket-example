We <br/>are adopting from China and the waiting time for adoptions is well over the 18 <br/>months that the USCIS approval is good for.  Therefore, we will have to file twice <br/>and will be subjected to double fees by our own Government, though we will have <br/>not received any additional services.  <br/>Costs, when adoptions took place within 18 months:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 or over 140%!
