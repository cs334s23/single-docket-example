This is<br/>unfair to<br/>  people trying to immigrate to the U.S..Many are in dire financial straights.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We are adopting a little girl from China with Cerebral Palsy. In addition<br/>to her<br/> adoption fees and immigration fees  we are looking at a lifetime of increased<br/>medical expenses. It&#39;s our <br/>desire to give an orphaned child a better life in our wonderful country. We<br/>sacrifice to do this. To learn our own government<br/> is making things more difficult is insulting to us and our good intentions.<br/>This will <br/>create hard ship for many adoptive families who are citizens of this country.
