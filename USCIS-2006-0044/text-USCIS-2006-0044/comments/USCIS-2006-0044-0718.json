I believe that <br/>there should be more effort made to speed up the process while still maintaining <br/>security for our country.  Some paperwork is redundant at best such as having to <br/>fill out and submit an I-865 Affidavit of Support for a change of status case that <br/>you had just filled out and submitted at an interview only weeks before.  <br/><br/>Some cases are more earnest than others.  If changing the fees will help speed <br/>up the waiting period that would be great.  When applying for a passport, one can <br/>pay a higher fee to process the passport in just few days.  If there were a graded <br/>fee like that for the immigration process, that would allow those who are not in <br/>great need to pay a lower fee and wait the longer period and allow those who need <br/>to be together sooner (Such as families with children and or pregnant wives) to <br/>pay the additional fee and have their paper work moved faster.<br/><br/>I personally would be willing to pay a much higher fee if it sped up the paperwork <br/>and even decreased some of the redundancy.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802094a2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:46:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-18T07:11:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Martin E.
