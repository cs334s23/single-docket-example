My husband and I <br/>have explored many options for starting our family and adoption is the choice that <br/>calls to us.  Adoption is an expensive road already, as well as being quite a roller <br/>coaster ride in many ways.  I feel that raising fees at USCIS for processes that <br/>are required for our adoptions (and sometimes required twice if our process <br/>streches out) by the drastic amount that is being proposed is simply not <br/>honorable.  I understand that everyone has their bridges to cross when starting a <br/>family, but to ask us to pay 100+% increases for some of these processes is <br/>unreasonable.  Please reconsider the adjustment of the fees associated with <br/>adoptive families and if you must raise these fess please be more prudent about <br/>the percent of increase.
