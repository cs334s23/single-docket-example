My husband and I adopted our daughter from China <br/>in November 2006.  Because the I-171-H expires after 18 months, we had to refile <br/>and pay almost $800 extra.  We ended up not even needing it because we got <br/>back from China 7 days before our first I-171-H expired.<br/><br/>I feel that the increase in fees for international adoption are unnecessary.  It is <br/>unfair to increase these fees when other fees are already so high for international <br/>adoption.  Please keep the rates at the current amount.  Help more children be <br/>united with their parents by keeping these fees low.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef50", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:10:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Joelle Holmquist", "trackingNbr": "8021ef50", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2815/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2815/attachments"}}}}}
