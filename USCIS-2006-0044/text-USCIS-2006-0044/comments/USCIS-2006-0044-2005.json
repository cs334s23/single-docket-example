As international adoption is <br/>a way to better the lives of children with literally no future in other countries, as <br/>well as better the lives of those families with either the inability to have children of <br/>their own or otherwise feeling the need to provide a future to a child, it is <br/>inconceivable that this agency would further raise the cost of private families&#39; own <br/>satisfaction their basic human rights.  Already couples and families are <br/>discouraged and turned away because of the exhorbitant cost of adoption.  <br/>Adopting families provide the world community a service by converting the status <br/>of a child from a numbered ward of the state, to that of a son/daughter and <br/>brother/sister.  The unadopted children, upon reaching maturity, will be left to their <br/>own devices to provide for themselves or find a place of belonging.  Without a <br/>family those children will become futher burdens of the state through crime or <br/>delinquency.  In this world of terrorism, the US cannot assume that the <br/>delinquency of another country does not affect our own lives.  I would think that <br/>the service provided by adopting families, already unrecognized, would not be <br/>further discouraged by higher costs.  Rather, the incentive of this agency, in this <br/>rulemaking, should be to ease the funancial burden of families who are simply <br/>seeking their own happiness and that of an orphaned child.   <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b5ba", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:16:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T18:50:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rey", "trackingNbr": "8021b5ba", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2005/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2005/attachments"}}}}}
