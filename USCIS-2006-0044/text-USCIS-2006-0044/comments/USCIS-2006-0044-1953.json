We have to file for a certificate of citizenship for both daughters<br/>since my husband is unable to travel.  With these new fees, this will cost us<br/>nearly $1000 just to receive this piece of paper, that other families where both<br/>parents travel receive for free. I thought it was expensive enough at $220, but<br/>you are looking to more than double this fee. Adoption is expensive enough and<br/>families feel as if we are being penalized because we chose to adopt a precious<br/>child from another country.  <br/><br/>Please reconsider this fee increase!!  Most families struggle to raise the funds<br/>for the adoption and then to have to return home and pay this additional fee is<br/>so hard!  <br/><br/>To receive the 171-H form for our first adoption cost about $100 less than the<br/>2nd time around, and that was only 2 years difference!!  These are just people<br/>trying to build a family! Our own government shouldn&#39;t be trying to make huge<br/>profits on this.  There is very little time involved in processing these forms<br/>and yet you want to raise the cost. <br/><br/>PLEASE reconsider!!!!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b39a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:08:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T14:49:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kristi S.
