Due to the longer <br/>wait times in China we already are incurring additonal expenses to re-submit the <br/>I600A application as our first I171H is due to expire in July. The increase is not a <br/>minimal one but a huge leap. The expenses incurred just to get to submit an <br/>application are hard enough but to increase the fees to this extent is just unfair. <br/>There has to be a better way. For parents like myself re-submitting and paying the <br/>same fees all over again for a duplication of work when a simple renewal form <br/>would decrrease our overall I171H expenses just doesn&#39;t make sense. I&#39;d rather <br/>spend the proposed increase on the child I have waited my whole life for. I <br/>sincerely hope that more of a discussion is held about this issue prior to its <br/>approval.<br/><br/>Kimberly Gaudiosi<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802098fc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:14:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-20T15:22:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kimberly A.
