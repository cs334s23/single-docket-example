People attempting to<br/>adopt internationally are facing ever increasing wait times due to many factors<br/>ranging from more regulation in the sending country to the increase of the<br/>number of people wishing to adopt from outside the US. While it is not within<br/>the power of the Federal government to reduce this wait time, it is within their<br/>power to prevent the already expensive process from costing even more. Already<br/>most PAPs are being faced with renewing renewing the I171H at least once in<br/>order to continue the pursuit of an adoption. In some cases, two times! For each<br/>time that happens, the couple or individual must spend thousands on homestudy<br/>updates (required both by their state and the USCIS) in addition to the fees for<br/>the new I600A. Please do not add to the burden we already carry by increasing<br/>the amount we must pay in an attempt to make our families complete.<br/>Regards,<br/>Janice Van Slimming<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480210559", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T18:42:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-08T21:33:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Elton Gallegly", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Janice van Slimming", "trackingNbr": "80210559", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1098/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1098/attachments"}}}}}
