As a new parent of an adopted child, my wife and I have paid <br/>considerable amounts of money so that we can fulfill our dreams of starting a <br/>family.  There are many hardships, most importantly financial, for those that adopt <br/>and I believe increasing fees will only hinder and discourage those whose only <br/>chance to start a family is through adoption.  <br/><br/>In my profession, I fight unjustified fee increases and unfunded federal mandates <br/>on a daily basis.  The fees that are proposed are unjustified.  They are <br/>approximately a 14% and 23% increase.  There are no new, improved, or fast-<br/>tracked services being offered to justify the increase - only an increase for <br/>revenue.  I will guarantee the majority of those adopting will have to resubmit a <br/>new I-171H due to its time limitations that will again increase our costs.  <br/><br/>The proposed changes include:<br/>1.) Biometrics (fingerprints) from $70 to $80 per person, and <br/>2.) the I-600A from $545 to $670. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the fees are unjustified and with each increase, no matter how <br/>small it may seem, will price out caring individuals and couples from being able to <br/>adopt.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aa78", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T02:49:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T20:47:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Michael J.
