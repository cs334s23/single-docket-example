This does not even account for the time that it takes <br/>from the time you submit your I600A and fingerprinting and when you get approved <br/>by the I171H months later. Combined, it is highly likely that your applications <br/>(I171H) will expire before your adoption is completed and you are going to have to <br/>pay twice. Your review and justifications for increasing rates is extensive, but fails <br/>to account for changes in the processing time by the US and foreign governments. <br/>I assume that you chose the original expiration dates (15 mos. for fingerprinting <br/>and 18 mos. for the I171H) based on the normal timeframes for adoption. Before <br/>increasing the rates, you should incorporate these increased timeframes to adopt <br/>or reduce the fees when renewing to accomodate the increased adoption times. I <br/>hope you were at least that aware of this! There is legislation to increase the <br/>expiration dates, but it has not passed as yet. Don&#39;t increase the rates <br/>anticipating passage.
