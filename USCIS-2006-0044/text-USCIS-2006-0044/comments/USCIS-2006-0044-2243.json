For example, people adopting from China are currently waiting about <br/>20 months to travel to China to get their children.  The I-717H form, allowing a US <br/>citizen to adopt a child from a foreign country and bring them back to the states, <br/>expires after 18 months.  Thousands of American families are already paying the <br/>USCIS twice to adopt the same child.  Increasing the fees is adding insult to <br/>injury.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c497", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:51:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T21:47:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Amy", "trackingNbr": "8021c497", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2243/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2243/attachments"}}}}}
