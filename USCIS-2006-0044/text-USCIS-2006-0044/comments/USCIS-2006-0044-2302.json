This is way beyond <br/>what the mark of inflation is already at.  It costs a small fortune to adopt children <br/>internationally now and to increase the fees and create more of a burden <br/>financially on adoptive parents is absurd.  How can anyone afford the fees for this <br/>and is it right to cause a child who is now a citizen to not have a certificate to hold <br/>in their hands and be proud of due to a massive increase in fees?  I have two <br/>daughters who are eligible for this and I dont believe they will be getting one <br/>anytime soon at what fees are currently being proposed.  I guess I will have to tel <br/>my daughters that their governemnts fees are the reason they cannot show this <br/>certificate to anyone due to its high cost<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cde0", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:50:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T16:41:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "SENATORS HILLARY CLINTON & SCHUMMER", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Alfred Tumielewicz", "trackingNbr": "8021cde0", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2302/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2302/attachments"}}}}}
