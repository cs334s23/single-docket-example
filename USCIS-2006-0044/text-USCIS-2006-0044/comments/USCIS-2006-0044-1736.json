Adoption is already very costly, and there is nothing that the <br/>US can do for its families regarding foreign fees. This is one area where the US <br/>can help its families while providing homes for orphaned children. Many people <br/>decide international adoption is not an option for them because of financing, and <br/>this should NEVER be a reason a child goes without a family. Even organizations <br/>that give grants for international adoption often require CIS approval before giving a <br/>grant, which means the CIS fee comes out of pocket and is not (as commonly) <br/>reimbursed. Please reconsider this hefty fee increase. It makes a difference for <br/>thousands of the world&#39;s children each year!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219fd9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:19:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T22:26:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80219fd9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1736/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1736/attachments"}}}}}
