We have had no success in <br/>adopting in the US (birth mother changing mind) that we moved forward and <br/>applied to China.  This has been a huge financial hardship to our family for the <br/>various fees that the US and China charges , as well as when we have to travel to <br/>China.  Increasing the fees by 66 % of what they currently are now will be an even <br/>added expense to our adoption.   This  will  put us over our budget for the adoption <br/>that and  will now make it possible that we won&#39;t be able to through with the <br/>adoption.  I implore you to please not raise the fees at this time.  I do believe that <br/>the  US has to have the families in mind first who are going to adopt and realize <br/>the financial burden adoption has become just to give a child who doesn&#39;t have a <br/>family a home. Please don&#39;t raise these fees!!!!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219db9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:37:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:33:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Tim Bishop", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Patricia Corcoran", "trackingNbr": "80219db9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1667/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1667/attachments"}}}}}
