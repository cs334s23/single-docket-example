I am a two time veteran therefore, of applying <br/>and going through your expesive process to receive the proper paperwork for an <br/>international adoption.  I am writing to strongly request that you not increase the <br/>cost for applying for I-171 H.  Because the timeline in China is taking so long to <br/>match parents with children, we are already facing paying this exorbinant fee a <br/>second time for one adoption.  We also paid more for fingerprinting for our second <br/>aoption than for our first. It is not fair, just or right.  We have no choice but to jump <br/>thorugh your hoops but... Can you not do this simple job on the already 850 plus <br/>dollars we pay for this simple process of background check??   We are already <br/>financially discriminated againt as international adoptive parents as opposed to <br/>biological parents.  <br/>PLEASE LISTEN to us and take our requests into account!!!!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802095b7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:48:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-19T19:44:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Adoptive parent", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kathryn M.
