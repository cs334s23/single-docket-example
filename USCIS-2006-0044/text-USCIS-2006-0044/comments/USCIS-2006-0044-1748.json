I believe our federal government should, in the name <br/>of human rights and family values, encourage people to adopt children from overseas, and keeping <br/>fees low serves as an incentive to this. <br/><br/>Adoptive parents want children so badly that they are willing to jump through multiple hoops and <br/>pay multiple fees to create a family. They should be rewarded, not punished, for making it as far as <br/>they do, to the point where they can actually bring a child home to Untied States, where he or she <br/>will have so many opportunities for improved health, education and, most of all, loving support. <br/><br/>Please keep imigration fees low for adopted children! <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a01d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:20:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:04:25Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021a01d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1748/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1748/attachments"}}}}}
