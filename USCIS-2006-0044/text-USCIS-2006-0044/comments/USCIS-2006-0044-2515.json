I for one don&#39;t have a <br/>problem paying the additional fees, but only if I can be guaranteed a much faster <br/>turn-around time in receiving my 171H and only if I don&#39;t have to pay these fees a <br/>second time because my adoption is taking longer than 15 or 18 months.  If you&#39;re <br/>going to increase the fees than at least provide families with more time to <br/>complete their adoptions or at the very least provide a significant reduction in fees <br/>if adoptions are taking longer than 15 month and 18 months. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dbb9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:19:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T13:15:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Debra Weeks", "trackingNbr": "8021dbb9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2515/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2515/attachments"}}}}}
