However, the backlog has increased, it takes many <br/>months to review and process the final application. For example, I aided my <br/>brother in law, a naturalized citizen, apply to bring his mother here usiing I-130. <br/>For two years the processing centers in Vermont, Dallas, California and Louisiana <br/>kept moving her paperwork around, but finally notified him in July of the paperwork <br/>going to the consulate office in Panama for her to get her for travel. Unfortunately, <br/>she die while visiting her daughter, my wife, before the process could be finished. <br/>This is money lost dueto the inefficiency of your agency in processing submitted <br/>applications. Personally, I take these fee increases to be another way that the US <br/>government is trying to prevent immigrants from coming to America. The fees are <br/>exorbitant, as well as ludicrous. A few weeks ago your agency had the audacity to <br/>tell my wife it will take six months to replace her stolen green card, yet your fee <br/>increase proposal says the processing time for I-90 should decrease to two <br/>months. Why should I or any other citizen have to pay a proposed cost of $290 to <br/>replace a card you have information on and should take less than two or more <br/>months to process? Your agency should seek full funding from Congress, rather <br/>than keep increasing fees for services that are subpar.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f96d5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-01T16:50:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-01T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T16:45:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anthony Davis", "trackingNbr": "801f96d5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0010/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0010/attachments"}}}}}
