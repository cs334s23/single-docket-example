USCIS does not <br/>have any sort of renewal system for I600/600A applications, so adoptive parents <br/>are stuck paying the fee twice AND paying for fingerprints twice.  No apparent <br/>reason for that other than to make money.  A person&#39;s fingerprints don&#39;t change.<br/><br/>I wholehearted disapprove of increasing fees at USCIS, particularly for orphan <br/>petitions.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cc3f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:02:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T14:03:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent, Patti Urban", "trackingNbr": "8021cc3f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2279/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2279/attachments"}}}}}
