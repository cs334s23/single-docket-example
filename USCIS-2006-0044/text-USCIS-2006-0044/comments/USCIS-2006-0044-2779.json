Our West Palm Beach, Florida office is so slow in processing I-600A (they are <br/>proud to announce that it only takes 4 months), that we have to call our local <br/>representatives to get our I-171H processed within the 4-month timeframe.  This <br/>timeframe is unacceptable for the hundreds of dollars already being paid and <br/>partciularly unacceptable with a fee increase!<br/><br/>2.  Child matches from China are taking longer and longer and I-171H&#39;s are <br/>expiring before adoptive families are approved to travel; therefore, they have to <br/>refile a new I600-A for the same adoption incurring the same costs a second time.<br/><br/>3.  An I-171H is only good for 18 months and the USCIS will not allow it to be <br/>renewed.  Adoptive families have to file a new I-600A and pay the fee again for an I-<br/>171H that was already approved.<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing me to voice my opposition to this fee increase.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Laura L.
