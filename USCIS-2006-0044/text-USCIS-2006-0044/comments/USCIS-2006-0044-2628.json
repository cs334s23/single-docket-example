With <br/>adoptions taking longer and longer, most of us have to file again as they agency <br/>does not permit us to renew our filing.  We are required to pay the full price again!<br/><br/>Here is what it costs to file with USCIS for a single person just to adopt:<br/><br/>What it used to be when adoptions took place within 18 months:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 <br/><br/>Total: $615<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = 1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 2 = $160<br/><br/>Total: $1500<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $885 or over 140%! That&#39;s how much more USCIS will<br/>make on just us, adopting parents, with no increase in services.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s not even taking into consideration the fact that applying<br/>for our children&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) goes from $215 to<br/>$460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase. Sometimes, we don&#39;t<br/>even get the certificates for a year after filing!<br/><br/>If you feel the need to increase the fees, then, at least, increase the service to <br/>match.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>K.
