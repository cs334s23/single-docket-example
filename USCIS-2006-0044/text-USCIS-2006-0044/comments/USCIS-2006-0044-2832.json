Today the exact<br/>same form costs a prospective adoptive parent $545. Biometric<br/>fingerprinting, which began in 1998, has risen in cost from $25 to<br/>$70 per applicant. For a two-parent family adopting a single child,<br/>the USCIS process costs an upward of $685. Because of the instability<br/>concurrent with international adoption, many families find that their<br/>USCIS approval expires prior to their invitation to travel to their<br/>prospective child&#39;s birth country. As a result, many families<br/>(especially those adopting from China and Guatemala) find themselves<br/>repeating the entire immigration application two or three times. This<br/>can increase the cost of an adoption by thousands of dollars ? money<br/>many of us simply do not have.<br/><br/>The department admits that it&#39;s not happy with its track record in<br/>processing applications and with its customer service. Processing<br/>throughout the regional offices is erratic ? some I-600A applications<br/>take months to process, while individuals in other districts received<br/>approval of the exact same form within ten days. The refusal of<br/>officials to give adoptive parents priority results in children<br/>languishing in orphanages or foster care overseas for months and<br/>months at a time. Most egregious is that the processing time for<br/>immigrant workers (I-140) and employment authorization (I-765) are<br/>less (average of 3.31 and 1.97 months, respectively) than that to<br/>bring home an orphaned child (3.39 months). There is no explanation<br/>for why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected 859,543 <br/>I-765 and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A<br/>applicants. Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given<br/>greater scrutiny than adult foreign workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition<br/>are met with deaf ears and directed to a &quot;status&quot; website which is<br/>not updated. As a result of USCIS&#39; refusal to prioritize orphan<br/>petitions, thousands of children suffer needlessly. There has been <br/>no move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive parents whose<br/>documents &quot;expire&quot; while they wait for their child&#39;s home country <br/>to grant them approval to travel. These parents are forced to reapply<br/>with USCIS, repaying the same exorbitant fees two and sometimes three<br/>additional times, each time subjecting themselves to the same long<br/>and uncertain wait for immigration approval. If USCIS would simply<br/>extend the &quot;expiration&quot; deadline for the I-171H from eighteen months<br/>to three years, it would significantly reduce its workload without<br/>having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for<br/>what it needs. It is asking for what it wants. It claims that this<br/>fee increase &quot;is designed to provide for an adequate and sustainable<br/>level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and processes<br/>designed to improve the USCIS&#39; ability to administer the nation&#39;s<br/>immigration laws.&quot; The Bureau justifies these increases by asserting<br/>that &quot;this fee rule would provide the necessary resources to maintain<br/>these processing time standards and fund further improvements to <br/>USCIS business operations to continue to reduce processing times <br/>while ensuring the appropriate level of security.&quot;<br/><br/>While we agree with the aims of the Department of Homeland <br/>Security, the additional levels of scrutiny on orphaned children <br/>and their prospective parents is absurd. While the aims of the<br/>department are laudable (reducing identity fraud, improving service,<br/>changing benefit applications from paper to electronic means in <br/>order to streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to bear<br/>the burden of these goals is unconscionable. Worse still, many of<br/>USCIS&#39; stated aims do not directly benefit those seeking to <br/>immigrate.<br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and<br/>loss, and are mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings<br/>to bring home a child. Increasing the burden on us is not simply<br/>unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of waiting children. We urge<br/>rejection of the current proposal and a new requirement that USCIS<br/>reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first priority to<br/>I-600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork required for <br/>orphan petitions, and extend the &quot;expiration&quot; of the I-171H<br/>from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Le Anne Kieffer<br/>Mother to a beautiful boy from Kazakhstan<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021efb4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:47:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Le Anne Kieffer", "trackingNbr": "8021efb4", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2832/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2832/attachments"}}}}}
