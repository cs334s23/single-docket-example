It is a certainty that<br/>every family who has a dossier in China will experience the expiration of their<br/>fingerprints (valid for 15 months) and I-171H/I-797C approval (valid for 18<br/>months).  The cost, both emotionally and financially of filing a new I-600A will<br/>already be very high. For us this also means another 8 hour drive.<br/><br/>It has now been brought to our attention that USCIS has a proposal to raise some<br/>of their fees. Not only is this frustrating to us as adopting parents but<br/>discouraging as well. The costs to bring an unwanted orphan into this country<br/>are already astronomical and now our own government is increasing this burden. I<br/>ask that you please reconsider this proposal and consider the following proposal<br/>instead:<br/><br/>1)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Effective immediately, set the valid period for all newly issued<br/>I-171H/I-797C from 18 to 24 months.  <br/>2)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Effective immediately, allow all families holding a valid I-171H/I-797C to<br/>file and be approved for an extension to 24 months within 30 days after<br/>submitting the following documents:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>a.  A copy of their current I-171H/I-797C and valid fingerprints   <br/>b.  A Home Study update to ensure that families still qualify to adopt from<br/>China.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Valerie Flynn <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207ac3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T18:41:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T19:12:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Valerie Flynn", "trackingNbr": "80207ac3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0480/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0480/attachments"}}}}}
