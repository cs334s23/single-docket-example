The significant <br/>increase in filing fees for I-140 and I-485 would deter many of the self-sponsored <br/>EB1-EA / EB2-NIW petitioners. In general many employers do not provide support <br/>for EB1-EA and EB2-NIW petitions since they are not sponsored by the employer <br/>and the benificiary has no obligation towards the employer. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>EB1-EA and EB2-NIW beneficiaries are arguably the most beneficial to the United <br/>States. Detering such people by steep increases in filing fees would adversely <br/>impact the scientific and cultural advancement of the United States. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>The final issue is the steep increase in fees for naturalization. Current permanent <br/>residents are unrestricted in their ability to work in the United States and are very <br/>likely to stay in the United States for the rest of their life. In such a scenario it <br/>certainly makes sense from a security perspective that as many as possible <br/>become citizens and pledge their allegiance to the United States. Detering people <br/>from naturalization by increasing the fees for N-400 would be a major concern for <br/>security of Unites States given the current situation.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480200dbe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-12T17:38:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-12T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-11T03:03:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80200dbe", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0298/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0298/attachments"}}}}}
