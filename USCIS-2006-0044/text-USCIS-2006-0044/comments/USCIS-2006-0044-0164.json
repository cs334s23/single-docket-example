I think what USCIS should do is to increase the<br/>current fees no more than 20% . (except the Entrepreneur cases, my idea is they<br/>should even pay more than the proposed fees) <br/>However,<br/>USCIS must make &quot;PREMIUM PROCESSING&quot; available for almost any kind of<br/>application starting with I-130 and I-485 immediately.
