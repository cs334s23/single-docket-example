We will have to have a second <br/>round of fingerprinting before we will be able to travel to China and pick up our <br/>child.  In addition to the increased costs, for us that means my 87 year old <br/>mother, who lives with us, will need to be fingerprinted.  This retired school <br/>teacher had to travel downtown to be fingerprinted twice EVEN though the <br/>computer approved the prints.  Through the FBI, she had to be fingerprinted three <br/>times.  It would appear to be a waste of your agency&#39;s time to not have <br/>accomodations for such situations.  The time frame and the cost should be re-<br/>evaluated to determine if there is a lower cost, longer time period for the <br/>approvals.  People trying to adopt are not a terrorist threat, just hopeful that the <br/>next hoop we jump through will bring us our child.<br/>Thank you. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bd7c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-28T16:12:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-27T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T22:36:20Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Barbara J.
