My own is coming from the <br/>standpoint of an adoptive parent.  I am currently a US citizen and am adopting a <br/>child from China.  The proposed fee increase would have a significant impact on <br/>my adoption.<br/><br/>I can understand fees and even fee increases, however I believe the proposed <br/>increases are a bit steep.  Please take into consideration the time limits set on <br/>these documents.  Because of the wait with our current adoption and the short <br/>expiration dates on the USCIS documents, we will have to pay the application and <br/>fingerprint fees twice because the documents will expire.  In addition, these <br/>documents will require an updated homestudy which also adds additional costs.<br/><br/>Please know that this increase impacts not only persons immigrating to the US, <br/>but also current US citizens.  While many people may be opposed to international <br/>adoption over adoption from foster care, that is not the issue here.  The issue is <br/>that I currently am a US citizen and am using my freedom to choose to grow my <br/>family in the manner I feel is best.<br/><br/>Thank you for your careful consideration with this matter.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dfdc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T02:27:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021dfdc", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2612/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2612/attachments"}}}}}
