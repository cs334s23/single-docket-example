According to USCIS <br/>the date is not current so they cannot issue visa. If the date is not current that <br/>means they obviously dont have anything to work on till the date becomes current. <br/>Why then should we keep waiting and paying for the system that does not even <br/>work? <br/>President wants the whole green card process including labor certification to clear <br/>in no more than 6 months. Here I have been waiting since Apr/2002. Thats my <br/>priority date. There are people waiting who have filed even before me. The <br/>immigrant visa process needs a thorough overhaul. When the VISA number is not <br/>avaliable, it creates artificial backlogs that are being used to increase the fees. If <br/>the people were not stuck and getting out of the system in a timely manner this <br/>situation would not have even come. <br/>I am against any quick fix. Please fix the process so that wait times are no longer <br/>than 6 months and if you need more people to achieve that goal than its justified.<br/>No more fee increase!!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206bfa", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T01:23:21Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T01:25:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Girish", "trackingNbr": "80206bfa", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0425/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0425/attachments"}}}}}
