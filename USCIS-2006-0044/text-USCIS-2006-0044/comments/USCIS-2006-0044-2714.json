That&#39;s how much more USCIS will<br/>make on just us, adopting parents, with no increase in services.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s not even taking into consideration the fact that applying for our<br/>children&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) goes from $215 to<br/>$460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase. Sometimes, we don&#39;t even<br/>get the certificates for a year after filing!<br/><br/>This is absurd!  I hope you all can figure out a better way to fund our<br/>government.  When you are lowering taxes for the top 10% of the US income<br/>population, it seems a bit odd that these fees are  rising by so much!<br/><br/>Thank you for listening....one of many concerned middle income adoptive parents<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e6fd", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:40:15Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T02:26:10Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Susan Kask", "trackingNbr": "8021e6fd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2714/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2714/attachments"}}}}}
