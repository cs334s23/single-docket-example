We pay <br/>enough already.  Perhaps you should improve your service before attempting to <br/>double the fees.  We&#39;ve gone through one international adoption and are in the <br/>middle of our second.  The level of incompetence we&#39;ve experienced from USCIS <br/>has been mind blowing.  How on earth do you justify increasing the fees and, in <br/>some cases, doubling fees with the lack of service you provide?  There is no <br/>justifiable reason as to why the fees should be increased as much as you are <br/>proposing.  In some cases, there would be a 66% increase.  It appears that you <br/>are attempting to double the fee for a certificate of citizenship.  This document <br/>should be wholly unnecessary, yet families who adopt from Korea must obtain <br/>one and pay an already unconscionable fee.  The law states that my child is a <br/>citizen from the day he is adopted by me.  Yet for no good reason, I have to get <br/>Certificate of Citizenship in order to prove to our government that he is a citizen.  <br/>This money-making scheme has clearly been proposed by people who have never <br/>gone through the adoption process.  Families who adopt internationally already <br/>have to pay a minimum of $20,000 in order to adopt a child.  There is no reason <br/>as to why we should be further gouged by our own government.  Please re-think <br/>your proposed fee increases for I-600, I600A and N600 forms.  I, as well as many <br/>in the adoption community, would like to know the reasons behind such a large <br/>fee increase.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef6c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:19:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Katherine", "trackingNbr": "8021ef6c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2821/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2821/attachments"}}}}}
