It already costs more than $30,000 <br/>to adopt a child from a foreign country, how could you think to increase this <br/>amount?  Many people can&#39;t even afford to adopt a child living in an orphange, <br/>even though they would love to give a child a home.<br/><br/>Not only that, but as citizens of America, we were treated poorly by CIS <br/>employees during our entire international adoption process.  It took several <br/>months and 3 trips to get fingerprinted before we were even approved!  If you hired <br/>people with better work ethics, maybe you could save some money.<br/><br/>Please rethink these increases!!<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219db1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:36:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:30:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jean", "trackingNbr": "80219db1", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1664/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1664/attachments"}}}}}
