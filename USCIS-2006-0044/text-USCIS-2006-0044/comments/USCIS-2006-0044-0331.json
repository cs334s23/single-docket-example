For an example,  the reinstatment <br/>applicaiton of F-1 status is currently instructed to continue to submit to local <br/>district office and, then the local district office will forward the reinstatement <br/>applications to Vermont Service Center. Which office will send adjudication <br/>decision? The code of Federal Resister indicated that &quot;The district director may <br/>consider granting the request...&quot; Then it should be forwarded back to the disctrict <br/>office after Vermont Service Center processed. It seems that this route system for <br/>only mentioned reinstatement application takes time and resource. Could DHS <br/>seek better way?<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802035d5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-13T14:00:21Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-13T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-12T22:21:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "802035d5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0331/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0331/attachments"}}}}}
