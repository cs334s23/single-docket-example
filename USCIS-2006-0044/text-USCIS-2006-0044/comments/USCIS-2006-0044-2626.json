Adoption is already a costly expense, we are<br/>recommending that the fees for adoption should be held because, for many of us,<br/>we have to file TWICE because the approval is only good for 18 months. With<br/>adoptions taking longer and longer, most adoptive paretns have to file again as<br/>you do not permit us to renew our filing - and make us pay the full price again!<br/> Adoptive families are trying to help the outrageous number of orphaned children<br/>of the world find their forever home.  The children deserve it - they did not<br/>choose the circumstance they were born into by their parents.  Please help it<br/>remain &quot;attainable&quot; for the working class families.  We do not want to get loans<br/>to extend our families, nor do we want to see such an painful increase from your<br/>office.  We really are just working class citizens trying to forefill our dreams<br/>and desires of helping a child live a life worth living, and not in an orphage.<br/><br/>Here is what it currently costs to file with USCIS for a couple just to adopt:<br/><br/>What it used to be when adoptions took place within 18 months:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 or over 140%! That&#39;s unreasonable, especially with no<br/>increase in services.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s not even taking into consideration the fact that applying for our<br/>children&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) goes from $215 to<br/>$460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase. Sometimes, for what we&#39;ve<br/>been told, one doesn&#39;t get the certificates for a year after filing!<br/><br/>Please reconsider your increases.  If you do deem them necessary, at least<br/>consider a &quot;renewal&quot; fee for those who already endured the first fee.  <br/><br/>Thank you, <br/>Colorado Citizens<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e0d8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:05:38Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T05:30:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Paul and Lisa", "trackingNbr": "8021e0d8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2626/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2626/attachments"}}}}}
