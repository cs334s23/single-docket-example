It&#39;s 4 years since we <br/>adopted our 2nd daughter, we&#39;re still paying off the expenses while incurring more <br/>to get both daughters&#39; Certificate of Citizenship! If the fees go up for this <br/>Certificate, I would have to finance the applications because for 2 children, this <br/>piece of paper would be over $800!!!!  This amount of money on top of all the <br/>money adoptive parents put out is outrageous!!!  Please don&#39;t do this to people <br/>who just want to have a family like everyone who can deliver a baby at a hospital, <br/>with insurance coverage and maternity leave from work. We experience enough <br/>pain emotionally and financially, please don&#39;t add to our financial burden just to <br/>have the joy of parenthood.<br/><br/>I am also curious why the fees would be going up and why to the numbers <br/>proposed?<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c61f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:57:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T01:01:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Gail Miller", "trackingNbr": "8021c61f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2254/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2254/attachments"}}}}}
