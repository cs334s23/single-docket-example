I think they are outrageously high <br/>and generate very little benefit. If, before the fees are implemented, efficiency is only expected to <br/>improve 20%, it will almost certainly not even get to 15%, a paltry change in a ridiculously <br/>beaurocratic system. <br/><br/>Whether or not these fee increases are intended to purposely prevent immigrants from coming to <br/>this country and/or becoming citizens once they are here, that will certainly be the end result. <br/>People new to this country must struggle to get by, often making as little as $15,000 per year, <br/>which certainly doesn&#39;t leave much after food, rent, car and gasolline costs. If your intent is to <br/>make even more illegal aliens out of originally legal aliens, then pass your obscene rate hike. <br/>Otherwise, perhaps you could work on streamlining decision making processes and other <br/>symptoms of a beaurocracy gone wild.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206661", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T00:23:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T19:49:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Nancy Pottish", "trackingNbr": "80206661", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0400/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0400/attachments"}}}}}
