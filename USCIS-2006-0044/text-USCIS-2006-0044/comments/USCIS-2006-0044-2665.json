The amount of money <br/>necessary to adopt is already overwhelming to most and adding to that number <br/>would only decrease the amount of people willing to adopt.  Children all over the <br/>globe are in need of homes and because we have a high standard of living here in <br/>the US, families here need to be encouraged to adopt to help the cause.  <br/>Increasing fees is both unnecessary and will only ensure that boys and girls <br/>awaiting adoption stay in their orphanages and go without families.
