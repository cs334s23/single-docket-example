We have no control over these timeframes. We <br/>have already paid to have the paperwork and fingerprints done in full. <br/>Unfortunately, all I-600A applications are expiring due to the fact that they only <br/>remain valid for 18 months from date of issue. It was difficult enough to have to <br/>pay the fees once, but to pay INCREASED fees a second time will more than <br/>double our initial USCIS expenses. Please help your constituents in this matter. <br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Monica &amp; Kevin Giffhorn<br/>Mount Airy, MD<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207dc7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T19:25:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T21:55:29Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Roscoe Bartlett", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Monica & Kevin Giffhorn", "trackingNbr": "80207dc7", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0512/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0512/attachments"}}}}}
