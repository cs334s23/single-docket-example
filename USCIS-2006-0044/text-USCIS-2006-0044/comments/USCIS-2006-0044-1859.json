It is tough enough that the <br/>fees for adoption are so high already. Most of the fees are charged by US <br/>agencies, such as fingerprinting at the federal level AND state level, obtaining the <br/>proper documents (our birth certificates, marriage certificates, etc.) PLUS state-<br/>certifications, and the adoption agency fees. Also, with the international adoption <br/>process lengthening, most of the time all these documents expire before the <br/>adoption is finalized. Instead of giving us a break, we have to pay for all these fees <br/>all over again. This proposed bill will increase the fees by more than 50% if <br/>passed!!! This means, the fees we pay USCIS will increase by 100% if the <br/>application expires before the adoption is finalized. Please stop the proposed <br/>increase in fees!
