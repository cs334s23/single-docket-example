We do understand that USCIS want to solve their financial shortage. But <br/>the basic concept is, as a client or customer, people shouldn&#39;t be just asked to <br/>pay more without any guarantee of geting better or higher effcient service. Why <br/>USCIS never propose a plan to improve their current terrible processing speed. I <br/>think the most people would be more than happy to pay higher fee if they can <br/>really speed up their desperately slow processing. This is a free and fair country. <br/>But I am afraid to say we are the only customers who pay more but get less. In <br/>summary, regarding the current situtation, I have to firmly say I strongly oppose <br/>this proposal.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9aee", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T16:57:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T04:29:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "801f9aee", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0097/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0097/attachments"}}}}}
