The <br/>costs are already hundreds of dollars.  Plus, with the wait for adoptions (in many <br/>cases) longer than 18 months, many forms expire and we have to re-file and get re-<br/>fingerprinted.  That already doubles the cost.  With having to file twice AND  the <br/>price increase, the cost to file with USCIS for adoption increases over 140% for a <br/>couple!!!  There are no increases in services--it is a staggering increase for the <br/>same services we already receive.<br/><br/>I urge you to reconsider this enormous increase in cost.<br/><br/>Adoptive Parent--Carrie Piparo<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d83d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:34:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T01:32:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Carrie Piparo", "trackingNbr": "8021d83d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2461/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2461/attachments"}}}}}
