I am an adoptive parent of a child from China and am currently <br/>waiting to adopt my second child.  If the proposed rule is adopted, filing fees would <br/>increase by an average of 66% over current fees.  Adoption is expensive enough <br/>already, and it is unconscionable to raise fees by up to 66% for adoption-related <br/>petitions.  Because we have to file an I-600 A at the beginning of the process and <br/>the wait has gotten so long, we will most likely have to file a second time and/or <br/>have to get fingerprinted a second time because the wait has gotten so long and <br/>our currently approved petition will expire before we can complete the adoption.  To <br/>raise the fees on top of having to pay them twice is absolutely outrageous!  <br/>Please. please, please put a stop to this nonsense!  This is punishing families <br/>who are simply trying to make a difference in the lives of abandoned children, while <br/>adding to their families.  I&#39;m very concerned that this will create a huge financial <br/>hardship to our family as well as many other families who care about children.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219fb4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:19:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T22:10:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jill Horton", "trackingNbr": "80219fb4", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1730/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1730/attachments"}}}}}
