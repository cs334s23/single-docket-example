My reasoning <br/>for this is based in the area of International Adoption.  As a family currently in the <br/>adoption process, we have paid for the required services, but will have to pay for <br/>the services again even though we do not have our child yet.  It is not uncommon <br/>for families to have to pay for these services more than once per each adoption.  <br/>While there are tax benefits and ways to contribute to accounts that are similar to <br/>a 125/Cafeteria/HSA plan, these provide little relief during and even after the <br/>adoption takes place.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a8dc", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:54:48Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:56:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Christina L.
