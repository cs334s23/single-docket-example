This is second time <br/>increase in few year taxing on our income. If USCIS wants to save money it can <br/>take out inefficient 1-800 service. You can yourself try. This service is useless. <br/>Many times I have enquired status of my application. They have no idea of Priority <br/>date and Application date different. They would tell me that I should have got <br/>approval by now. They would raise an enquiry. And result of enquiry is a letter <br/>from USCIS saying I will get approval in six months. Many six months have came <br/>and gone, I am still in que. PLEASE HELP. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP FROM <br/>THIS USCIS MESS.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I have been in GC line for 5 year now. Every year I renew my EAD and <br/>Advance parole. Every time I renew by GC or Advance Parole, I don&#39;t get <br/>subsequent date. By subsequent date what I mean is if for 2003, my EAD was <br/>valid from April 23,2003 to April 22,2004. My next EAD validity will be date when I <br/>EAD is approved. My EAD could be approved in Feb,1,2004. So I lose 2-3 months <br/>time when I process my EAD. <br/>It is real mess. I would love to get chance to explain the mess created by USCIS. <br/>It is the person who goes through pain can understand pain.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020810e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-20T18:25:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-20T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T04:24:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rajesh Singh", "trackingNbr": "8020810e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0614/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0614/attachments"}}}}}
