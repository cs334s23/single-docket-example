International adoption is <br/>extremely difficult, expensive, and fraught with delays and snags.  Higher fees on <br/>this end will add to the problem and I certainly don&#39;t see where the service will be <br/>improved any.  It is downright difficult, if not impossible, to speak to anyone <br/>regarding our case, once filed.  It has become impossible to complete most <br/>adoptions in the time allowed (18 months for I-171H) and 15 months for <br/>fingerprints.  We already have to pay twice for these items.  Increasing the cost <br/>will simply penalize us more.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a84e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:56:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T17:07:02Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Janise D.
