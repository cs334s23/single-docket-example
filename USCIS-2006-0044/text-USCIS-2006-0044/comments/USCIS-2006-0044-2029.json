I&#39;ve already paid over <br/>$1,100 for the I600, fingerprinting and homestudy.  Chances are my CIS approval <br/>will expire before I will get my referral.  That means I have to pay another $1,100 <br/>plus to renew all my documents.  A total of over $2,000 for one adoption.  If the <br/>fees continues to increase, I believe the CIS approval should have a longer time <br/>frames to where families are not required to pay twice.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b6e6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:26:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T20:58:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by V.
