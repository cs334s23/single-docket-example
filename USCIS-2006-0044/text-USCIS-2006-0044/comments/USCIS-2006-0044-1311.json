Immigrants and refugees <br/>work hard and struggle to take care of their families and get an education. If the <br/>fees for permanent residency and citizenship are raised as proposed, a large <br/>number of potential citizens will be lost due to their inability to pay.  I understand <br/>that the Office of Citizenship must be self-supporting which is the reason behind <br/>the proposed increases. With the numbers of immigrants and refugees increasing <br/>each year, this method of paying for services is unacceptable.  The strength and <br/>diversity of our country has come from an immigrant population and, given the <br/>opportunity through a fair, equitable and reasonable process, this trend will <br/>continue.  If fees are increased as proposed, immigrants and refugees will be <br/>forced to decide between caring for their families or fulfilling their dream of <br/>becoming citizens of this great country.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021642c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-20T13:40:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-20T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-19T20:40:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Ron Wyden", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Lynda W.
