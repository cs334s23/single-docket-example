The<br/>current wait times for getting items processed are astronomical (I-600),<br/>fingerprints etc. Unless you can PROMISE that these fee increases are going to<br/>change that, then don&#39;t pad the already thick government offices that process<br/>these. Someone once published that based on the cost of the current I-600 and<br/>the time it truly requires to physically process it, you are getting paid<br/>hundreds of dollars to do a project that takes just minutes! It is unreal as it<br/>stands now!
