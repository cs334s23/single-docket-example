To raise fees by over 50% is just plain <br/>wrong. Clearly, mismanagment abounds if it is necessary to assess those kinds <br/>of increases. Those of us who adopt go through so much to bring our children <br/>home. Why is our own government putting more obstacles in our way instead of <br/>making it easier and more affordable to create loving, American families! I oppose <br/>the increases on these forms and feel that it would be a complete injustice to so <br/>many American families whose savings are already being put to the test simply by <br/>choosing to build their families through adoption. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219f08", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:52:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:57:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Amy Friedland", "trackingNbr": "80219f08", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1711/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1711/attachments"}}}}}
