I would like to see the work for <br/>much of this processes be streamlined and made more cost efficient, not just <br/>increase the charges to the consumer. It is especially notable that they were <br/>increased just two years ago a new 66% to 80% incease only two years later is <br/>evidence of poor management of time and resources.<br/><br/>I am an adoptive parent that has been through the I600 system 3 times in order to <br/>adopt a child. One quick solution to streamline. Fingerprints only last 12 months <br/>the I600 A lasts 18 months. Make them match. Make them both last two years so <br/>a family can get thier adoption finished before the paperwork runs out. Adoptions <br/>are taking longer and we adoptive parents would be happy to reduce the workload <br/>by not having to complete the same paperwork over and over for the same <br/>adoption. <br/><br/>Make the system work better rather than throw money at it. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dba2", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:19:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T13:00:04Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Susan V", "trackingNbr": "8021dba2", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2512/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2512/attachments"}}}}}
