While almost everybody agrees that adoption <br/>is a wonderful way to build a family and is sometimes the only hope for those <br/>suffering from infertility, very few realize how expensive adoption is. Increasing <br/>USCIS fees only further increases the financial burden for parents who are only <br/>trying to complete their families without providing any substantial benefit to USCIS <br/>since the numbers of international adoptions that take place annually is still very <br/>small. USCIS and the government can show that they really care about children <br/>and hard working parents who are trying to raise adoptive families by forgoing a <br/>fee increase for purposes of adoption.    <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a19e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:23:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T02:39:42Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By A.
