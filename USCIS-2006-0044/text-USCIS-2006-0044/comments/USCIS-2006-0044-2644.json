FAMILIES WHO ARE <br/>PURSUING THIS AVENUE FOR GROWING THEIR FAMILIES HAVE OFTEN <br/>TIMES EXPLORED AND VENTURED DOWN OTHER AVENUES BEFORE <br/>ARRIVING AT THE DECISION TO ADOPT FROM A FROEIGN COUNTRY. THEY <br/>HAVE OFTEN SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THEIR RESOURCES <br/>PRIOR TO MAKING THIS DECISION. THESE PARENTS WOULD NOT BE <br/>INCURRING THESE EXPENSES IF THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO HAVE <br/>CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN OR IF THE PROCES OF ADOPTION IN  THE US <br/>WAS MORE OF A  SURE THING. THE RAISING OF THESE FEES IS <br/>ESPECIALLY TROUBLING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO ADOPT <br/>FROM CHINA BECAUSE THEY NOT ONLY HAVE TO PAY THE  FEES ONCE, <br/>BUT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED WAIT TIME ARE NOW HAVING TO HAVE <br/>THEM DONE TWICE. THIS IMPOSES QUITE A HARDSHIP ON MANY OF THE <br/>ADOPTING FAMILIES BECAUSE IT IS AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE THAT <br/>INITIALLY HAD NOT BEEN PLANNED ON. IT IS BAD ENOUGH THAT THESE <br/>FAMILIES HAVE TO PAY THESE COSTS DONE ONCE, A FEE THAT WOULD <br/>NOT BE INCURRED IF THEY WERE ABLE TO BEAR THEIR OWN CHILDREN <br/>OR ADOPT DOMESTICALLY, BUT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS <br/>AND COST TWICE IS ABSURD. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO <br/>RECONSIDER THIS DECISION BEFORE MAKING YOUR FINAL DECISION.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e35d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:35:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T14:43:11Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021e35d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2644/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2644/attachments"}}}}}
