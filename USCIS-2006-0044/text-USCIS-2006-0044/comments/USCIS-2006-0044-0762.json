Currently, <br/>the projected wait time between receipt of our 171H and bringing our daughter <br/>home will be at least 20 months, probably more.<br/>Because our 171H must be current at the time of our dossier submission, its <br/>critical review in China, our being matched with our daugther and for our <br/>appointment with the US Consulate in Ghanzou, we will have to resubmit our I-<br/>600A and re-do our fingerprints at least once.<br/>Given the expirations of the 171H, the new rate increase will mean an additional <br/>cost burden to all families in the process of adopting. This cost will add to the <br/>overall expense of adopting -- an expense that is already out of line with middle <br/>income families. Therefore I ask that the cost increase be reconsidered.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Heather Beebe-Stevens<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a107", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T16:14:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-21T02:38:44Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Heather A.
