The <br/>fee seems quite high already. Personally, the process of adoption is stretching <br/>me financially to my limit. Any additional increases in the process would likely <br/>have made the costs too prohibitive. Also, since there is not a renewal available <br/>and approval is only good for 18 months, many adoptive parents pay two fees for <br/>no additional services. Please consider leaving the adoption fees as they currently <br/>stand.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration,<br/>A Concerned Waiting Adoptive Parent<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dfc3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T02:14:21Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Angie McDonald", "trackingNbr": "8021dfc3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2609/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2609/attachments"}}}}}
