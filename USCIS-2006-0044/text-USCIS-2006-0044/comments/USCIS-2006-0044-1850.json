Adoption is expensive enough already, and it is <br/>unconscionable to raise fees by up to 66% for adoption-related petitions. The <br/>process has become increasingly harder in most Countries, the fear of the <br/>unknown at the beginning of the process is already high for many couples who are <br/>not familiar with the Int&#39;l adoption process and most importantly, due to the length <br/>of time it now takes to adopt, <br/><br/>many families are forced to reapply for approval and/or fingerprints before they <br/>travel to the foreign country to adopt their child.  I strongly feel this would have a <br/>negative impact for many couples who want to adopt abroad.
