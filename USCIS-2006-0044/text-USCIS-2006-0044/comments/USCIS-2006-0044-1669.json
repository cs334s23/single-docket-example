As an adoptive parent, I know how expensive the adoption <br/>process is. With the increase in some wait times (China now takes 16 months to <br/>give a referral), we often incur additional fees when certain documents expire. The <br/>proposed petition increases would be an additional, significant burden on many <br/>families who are already engaged in a very expensive process.
