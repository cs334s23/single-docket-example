My <br/>daughter automatically became a citizen when she was adopted in 2002 and yet <br/>we are expected to pay through the nose for the proof of that? My second <br/>daughter got her Certificate of Citizenship automatically when she was adopted in <br/>2004. It is hard for me to understand why exactly USCIS has not retroactively <br/>issued C of C&#39;s to those children who ARE American citizens by law but whom <br/>the department couldn&#39;t get their act together to serve. These fees are already too <br/>high! My husband and I work for our living and are raising two small AMERICAN <br/>children. Surely it is not too much to expect some level of competence from the <br/>government agencies we support with our tax money.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e385", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:35:41Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T15:21:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Paula Anderson", "trackingNbr": "8021e385", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2645/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2645/attachments"}}}}}
