SINCE<br/>THEY HAVE TO EITHER IMMIGRATE THEIR FAMILY MEMBER OR BECOME A USC. ONE OF THE<br/>COMMENTS GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC STATES THAT IMMIGRANTS SHOULD PAY NOT THE TAX<br/>PAYER, WELL TO THAT PERSON SHOULD KNOW THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE ALSO TAX PAYERS EVEN<br/>NON-IMMIGRANTS WHO IN FACT CONTRIBUTE TO TAX AND ARE NOT AWARDED REFUNDS. IN<br/>THAT CASE IMMIGRANTS AND NON-IMMIGRANTS SOMETIMES PAY EVEN MORE. AS A U.S.<br/>CITIZEN I DECLINE TO ACCEPT THE INCREASE OF SUCH FEE, BUT WE NEED TO STOP LYING<br/>TO OUR SELF. THE GOV.
