My family is built by adoption and we know first hand <br/>how financially straining it is.  With potentially hundreds of dollars added on to the <br/>already very high costs it makes future adoptions more difficult, and could really <br/>discourage families that are already pressed to come up with all the adoption <br/>fees.  The government was kind enough to recognize the expense of adoption and <br/>to grant the adoption tax credit, please do not counter act this by adding more <br/>fees.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Cheryl Bissaillon<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a087", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:03:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:55:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cheryl M.
