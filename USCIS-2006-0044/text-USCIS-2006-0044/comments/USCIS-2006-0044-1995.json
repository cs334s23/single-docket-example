By raising <br/>the fees by such a substantial amount, the US government is actually preventing <br/>many people from adopting. I am a single parent and it already has caused me a <br/>great deal of financial hardship and I ask for your consideration not to raise the <br/>fees. Orphaned children belong in a good, stable home. Not necesssarily a very <br/>rich home. Please don&#39;t limit international adoption to only the wealthy. Please <br/>keep the fees as is.
