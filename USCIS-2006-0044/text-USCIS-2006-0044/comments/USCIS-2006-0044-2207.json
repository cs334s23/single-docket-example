It has been a challenge for us to come up with all the <br/>funds we need.  We have been looking into grants and scholarships to help us <br/>raise the money.<br/><br/>We were deeply troubled to hear that your agency is going to make it EVEN <br/>MORE difficult on us and many others who aren&#39;t loaded with money as we seek <br/>to help these children.  We are even going to be adopting an older child (13 years <br/>old) because they are basically unadoptable after age 7.  I would hate to think that <br/>some of them might not get homes due to the &quot;system&quot; in a wealthy country <br/>making it more difficult for families to get them.<br/><br/>Please reconsider your intention to raise the fees associated with adoption from <br/>outside the U.S.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>James C.
