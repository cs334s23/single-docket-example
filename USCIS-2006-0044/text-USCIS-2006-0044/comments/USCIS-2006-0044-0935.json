The increases <br/>only add one more issue to an already overwhelmingly complitcated situation that our elected <br/>officials as yet seem fit to sweep under the rug.  <br/><br/>If some form of temporary labor permit could be developed as a first step to help control our borders <br/>and supply needed workers then perhaps this obscene influx of innocent people could be controlled <br/>legally.  The illegal aspects of the border crossings would largely stop.  <br/><br/>The drug  and &quot;terror&quot; issues are not directly related to the worker issue.  Yet it seems our elected <br/>officials want to construct some tinker toy tower bill that will cover all aspects.<br/><br/>Is it not possible for someone or group in the USCIS to develop a plan and present it to the <br/>legislators that would address these issues for the wisest purposes rather than political reasons?  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bbb6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T16:57:44Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T16:18:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Gabriel Giffords", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment SUbmitted By Don Wenig", "trackingNbr": "8020bbb6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0935/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0935/attachments"}}}}}
