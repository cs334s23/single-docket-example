We ask that you <br/>do not increase your fees.  The cost of adoption is already very high.  We have <br/>already paid $140.00 for fingerprints and $545.00 for our I600.  We have been <br/>approved and we believe that that should be it.  The thought of having to reapply <br/>because of the slow down of our child match really worries me.<br/><br/>I wish you could help us adopting families out by extending how long the I171 is <br/>valid for.  And please do not increase your fees.<br/><br/>Thank you for you consideration.<br/><br/>Curt and Tammi Barber<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480215b03", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-19T15:34:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-19T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-18T17:08:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Curt and Tammi Barber", "trackingNbr": "80215b03", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1300/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1300/attachments"}}}}}
