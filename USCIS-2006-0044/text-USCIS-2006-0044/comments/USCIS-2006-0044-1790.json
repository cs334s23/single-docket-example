Adoption is expensive enough <br/>without a 66% increase in fees, some for repeating fingerprints that expire during the wait for a <br/>child.  If the quality of service went up 66%, then I could understand the desire to increase fees, but <br/>this is an unreasonably high increase put on the backs of people who are trying to give children a <br/>chance at life.  I have adopted twice from overseas, and it&#39;s very time consuming, cumbersome, <br/>and expensive to adopt as is, complicated when agencies don&#39;t follow the law or their own <br/>guidelines or request resubmission of fingerprints and applications and such during a lengthy and <br/>stressful wait for a child.  For the services given, I actually believe the fees should go down, not up, <br/>but at least they should not be raised, causing further financial strain on U.S. citizens forming their <br/>families and willingly opening their hearts and homes to needy children.  These fee increases do not <br/>serve U.S. citizens well.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a1b1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:24:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T02:47:39Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Dana Rohrabacher", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Susanna M.
