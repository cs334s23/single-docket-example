According to current USCIS regulations,<br/>this approval is valid for 18 months. However, due to the lengthy wait to be<br/>matched with a child from China, it is a certainty that every family who has a<br/>dossier in China will experience the expiration of their (1) fingerprints (valid<br/>for 15 months) and (2) I-171H/I-797C approval (valid for 18 months). The cost to<br/>adoptive families of filing a new I-600A (Advance Petition to Adopt an Orphan)<br/>will be very high, both emotionally and financially. The cost to USCIS offices<br/>of processing new I-600As will be also be very high, in terms of time and resources.<br/><br/>I humbly urge you to support the following recommendations:<br/><br/>1)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Effective immediately, increase the valid period for all newly issued<br/>I-171H/I-797C from 18 to 24 months<br/><br/>2)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Effective immediately, allow all families holding a valid I-171H/I-797C to<br/>file and be approved for an extension to 24 months within 30 days after<br/>submitting the following documents:<br/><br/>a.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>A copy of their current I-171H/I-797C and valid fingerprints<br/>b.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>A Home Study update to ensure that families still qualify to adopt from China<br/><br/>3)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Do not increase USCIS adoption-related fees<br/><br/>This is important because the burden of paying for and submitting a new I-600A<br/>for a file that is already approved seems to be a frivolous and poor use of<br/>USCIS resources. The cost to families is up to $2,000 and it seems that USCIS<br/>offices already face heavy caseloads. Aren?t there better uses for our time and<br/>money and the government?s time and tax revenue?<br/><br/>Won&#39;t you please extend the term for I-171 validity to 24 months and decrease<br/>(or hold steady, at the current level) USCIS adoption-related fees ?<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dfe5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T02:31:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by David Williams", "trackingNbr": "8021dfe5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2614/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2614/attachments"}}}}}
