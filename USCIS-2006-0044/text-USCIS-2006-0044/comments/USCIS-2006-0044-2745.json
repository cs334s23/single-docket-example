These citizens go<br/>to great lengths to secure the extensive funding necessary for adoption, and<br/>every increase in costs pushes adoption, and thus parenthood, beyond the realm<br/>of possibility for more families. <br/> <br/>Please do not increase fees for the above listed petitions and services, which<br/>would be to the detriment of hopeful, would-be parents.
