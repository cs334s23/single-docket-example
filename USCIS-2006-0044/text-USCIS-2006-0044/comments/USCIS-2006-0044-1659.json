My family is going through the process of adoption at this<br/>time.  We have already paid hundreds of dollars to get our I-600A and are going<br/>to have to pay those fees all over again because the wait time for Chinese<br/>adoption has tripled since we started.  Our papers and fingerprints will expire<br/>before we travel, therefore forcing us to go through the process all over again.<br/> It&#39;s hard enough on our budget to have to find another $615 for this.  But if<br/>this proposal passes, we will pay another 22% more.  Our adoption is costing<br/>around $20,000.  This equals half of my husband&#39;s yearly take-home pay.  We are<br/>sacrificing, though, because we feel very strongly about giving an orphan a<br/>loving home and a forever family to call her own.  Please consider the financial<br/>strain we, as adoptive families, are under.  Don&#39;t raise the fees and make it<br/>that much harder on us.  Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219d8c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:36:18Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:20:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By E.
