There are hundreds of thousands of children <br/>worldwide waiting to be adopted. This increase would mean that more children have to <br/>wait longer for loving homes and many people simply could not afford it due to this <br/>increase. It is already costing me over $20,000. to adopt a child from another counrty. <br/>This increase is huge !!! Please reconsider the increase or at least the outragous <br/>amount of increase. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219fe5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:19:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T22:32:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Gaylynn Clevenger", "trackingNbr": "80219fe5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1738/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1738/attachments"}}}}}
