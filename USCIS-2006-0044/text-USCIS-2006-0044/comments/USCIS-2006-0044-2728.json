For <br/>families wishing to adopt orphaned children from other countries this increase is <br/>unjustifiable. This would unduly add to the very substantial financial burden such <br/>families already endure to simply provide these needy children a loving home and <br/>upbringing, and an opportunity to fulfill the promise these children bring to <br/>America. And in cases where the length of the adoption process requires the <br/>documents be renewed, these hefty fees would have to be paid again!  Please <br/>reconsider this huge increase in fees and the tremendous burden it would place on <br/>adoptive families.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e794", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:41:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T04:50:08Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "US Rep.
