There are <br/>many many fees involved in an international adoption.  The costs associated with <br/>an adoption are what many would consider exorberant.  But as adoptive parents <br/>they are paid without hesitation.  It seems unreasonable first, when most <br/>adoptions exceed the <br/>allowable time on the I171H which is currently 18 months, and 12 months for <br/>fingerprints.  So not only are they required to pay these fees once, but a vast <br/>majority of <br/>the time families are taxed with paying these fees twice.  And now you want to <br/>force them to pay an increase in these fees up to 66%, twice!  Let&#39;s be fair about <br/>this.  For <br/>many adoption is the only choice they have to have a family.  They prove over <br/>and over again that they are suitable parents, by many governmental institutions.  <br/>It <br/>seems that they are being treated unfairly.  My daughter is one of those families <br/>that have <br/>been waiting in excess of a year.  Their fingerprints expire in two months and their <br/>immigration expires in 8 months.  Which unfortuanately will force them to pay fees <br/>that have already paid once to get a form they already have...Bottom line is that <br/>those waiting should not have to bear the burden of increased fees for the identical <br/>paperwork.  In fact once the paperwork is completed the first time it should not <br/>expire for the duration of that adoption effort.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ce96", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:50:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T18:05:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Jim Renwick", "trackingNbr": "8021ce96", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2405/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2405/attachments"}}}}}
