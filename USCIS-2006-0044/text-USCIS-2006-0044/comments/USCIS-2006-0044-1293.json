First off, <br/>the fees were recently increased not too long ago, so it wouldn&#39;t make sense to <br/>increase them again, so soon.  Also, with the cost of adoption already costing <br/>adoptive families so much, it would be additionally hard to come up with this new <br/>fee amount.<br/><br/>There are so many orphans throughout the world who need wonderful, loving <br/>families who can care for them and provide a safe place that they can call home.  <br/>Unfortunately, due the high costs of adoption, there are many families out there <br/>who would love to open their hearts and homes to these beautiful children, but <br/>can&#39;t because of a lack of funds.  This needs to change!<br/><br/>Instead, federal government departments want to raise the cost of necessary <br/>paperwork, which puts an even bigger gap between median income families who <br/>would love to somehow find a way to bring one of these children home.  Please <br/>don&#39;t do this!<br/><br/>I encourage you to keep the fees where they are.  Help us bring these orphans <br/>throughout the world to loving home they so need and deserve, by <br/>keeping &quot;paperwork&quot; fees down.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>Cammie S.
