A reasonable fee increase to reflect increases <br/>in actual processing costs and the effects of inflation is acceptable.  The increases proposed are <br/>not acceptable.  <br/>It is extremely expensive to adopt a child, domestic or international.  These additional fees make it <br/>even more difficult for an average family to open its home to an orphan.  These proposed increases <br/>are nothing more than an attempt to raise government revenue without the political risk of raising <br/>individual and corporate taxes.   <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a908", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:55:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T18:20:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anne Gilbert", "trackingNbr": "8021a908", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1864/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1864/attachments"}}}}}
