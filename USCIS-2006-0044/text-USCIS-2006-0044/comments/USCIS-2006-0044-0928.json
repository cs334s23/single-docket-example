There are long delays over 3 months now in waiting for the I-171H<br/>to be approved.  During this time, your fingerprints are aging.  Most families<br/>within just a few months have to begin the process again since their<br/>fingerprints will soon expire and of course they will then pay the fees again.  <br/><br/>This could be solved by fixing the process so that the fingerprints expire on<br/>the same date as the approval.  International adoptions are taking longer<br/>especially in China and a 24 month expiration would keep families from clogging<br/>the system with more paper and paying a second fee.  This is supposed to be a<br/>service we are paying for and not a revenue generation program.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020b561", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-26T15:02:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-26T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-25T03:51:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "me", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michael W.
