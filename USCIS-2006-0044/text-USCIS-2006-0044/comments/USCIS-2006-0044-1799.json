The international adoption process is already <br/>extremely expensive and increasing fees will make this dream even more difficult <br/>for families in the US hoping to adopt a child in need of a home and family. <br/><br/>If fees have not kept up with the actual costs over the years and there is no other <br/>solution other than to raise fees then they should be raised in stages so as not to <br/>present a hardship on families already stretched by the high costs involved in <br/>international adoption. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a1f1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:48:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T03:38:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Joyce E.
