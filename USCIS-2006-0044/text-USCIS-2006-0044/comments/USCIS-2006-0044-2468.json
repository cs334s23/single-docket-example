As <br/>parents that are going throught the adoption process at this time we are on a very <br/>tight budget to be able to afford this. People think that because you are adopting a <br/>child you must be rich well that is not true. We have sacrificed very much to make <br/>our dream of a child of our own come true. The expense is very high already and <br/>with the current law that makes us have to renew both the fingerprints and the I-<br/>600A already adding a higher fee is very hard for us to handle. Just remember that <br/>if everyone had to go through what adoptive parents had to to have a child there <br/>would be NO unwanted babies anywhere! Please Please do not raise these rates <br/>for us.<br/>Thank You!<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d872", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:34:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T02:12:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Virginia Stevans", "trackingNbr": "8021d872", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2468/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2468/attachments"}}}}}
