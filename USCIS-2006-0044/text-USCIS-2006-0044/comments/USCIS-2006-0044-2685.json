Another alternative would be to increase the amount of time the<br/>documents for an international adoption are valid from 18 months to at least 24<br/>months (and preferably 30 months).   Yet another alternative would be to offer a<br/>substantially lower fee to update the documents if they are nearing expiration<br/>and the adoption has not yet been completed.<br/><br/>A large fraction of international adoptions can not be completed within the<br/>specified 18 month window, therefore these families must re-apply and pay the<br/>full fees a second time.  Thus the USCIS receives 2x the fees from most adoptive<br/>families as compared with other petitioners.  Adoptive families generally have<br/>no control over the speed of their process once the paperwork has been sent to<br/>the country, so there is nothing they can do to avoid being double charged.<br/><br/>I am currently starting the process to adopt a child from China.  The current<br/>wait time once the paperwork is submitted is more than 18 months, and it is<br/>getting longer.  I just received my I-171H and I expect it to take 1-2 months<br/>before the papers will be officially registered in China.  So the wait from<br/>I-171H to child will be at least 20 months.  So I know I will be required to pay<br/>the USCIS fees again even though there is nothing I can do to speed up this<br/>process (and I would speed it up in a heartbeat if I could!!).<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration,<br/><br/>Laura Kramer<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e533", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T13:38:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T20:57:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Laura Kramer", "trackingNbr": "8021e533", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2685/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2685/attachments"}}}}}
