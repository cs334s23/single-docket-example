The US government fees for <br/>internationally adopting parents are already a significant obstacle to adoption, and <br/>with longer processing for adoptions now occuring, parents are asked to pay <br/>greatly increased fees not just once but twice!  Our own government fees should <br/>not be a further obstacle to potential adoptive parents, who face significant costs <br/>already in their attempts to provide a child a home.<br/>I am also dismayed to find the fee for a certificate of citizenship more than <br/>doubling!  This same certificate is now given at NO charge to children adopted by <br/>US citizens.  But for those whose children entered the country before 2001, the <br/>fee has risen TWICE in the last couple years, and is now rising to $460???  For a <br/>certificate that only reiterates what is already law???<br/>Children and others who are already US citizens should not have to pay nearly <br/>$500 for a certificate proving what the US government already recognizes.  I fear <br/>that increasing this fee will cause more people to go without this document at all. <br/><br/>Please reconsider this fee increase.  It is a strong potential barrier to adoption, <br/>and to US childrens&#39; ability to prove their rightful citizenship.  <br/><br/>Thank-you for your time and consideration,<br/>Leah Moore<br/>adoptive parent<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e0ab", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:05:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T04:59:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Leah Moore", "trackingNbr": "8021e0ab", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2623/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2623/attachments"}}}}}
