To try and validate <br/>the hike of the I485 to $905 is unbelievable, &#39;oh well we worked out that people <br/>who apply for an I485 will also apply for a travel document or two whilst they&#39;re <br/>waiting along with other sundry documents we can charge them as they must <br/>have the money&#39;. All the applicants have is patience and lots of it because the <br/>service from USCIS is terribly slow. We only need additional documents as the <br/>I485 takes so long to process.<br/>I have already paid for an I129f application, travel to London twice, $400 for a <br/>medical, a K1 fiance visa, an 1485 and an I765 with the promise of more form <br/>filling in once I&#39;ve been here two years. I&#39;m willing to work, willing to pay taxes but <br/>because USCIS  are so slow, my wife is supporting me. <br/>I&#39;m (nor are other applicants) a burden on the US as we have to provide an affadivit <br/>of support from our wives/husbands and sign away any right to be a burden on the <br/>state for upto ten years, despite being lawfully here and paying taxes.<br/>To anyone that thinks this is good for the US because all the &#39;illegals&#39; in their <br/>neighborhoods are bringing their areas down get this into your dumb <br/>heads, &#39;illegals&#39; are just that, illegal, they do NOT make themselves known to the <br/>USCIS for obvious reasons.<br/>Raise the prices and drive away all the good people. Yeah, that&#39;s a real cool <br/>plan ... not.<br/>ROGER (US resident, UK citizen)<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fc2c6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-06T22:07:22Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-06T20:45:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Roger", "trackingNbr": "801fc2c6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0205/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0205/attachments"}}}}}
