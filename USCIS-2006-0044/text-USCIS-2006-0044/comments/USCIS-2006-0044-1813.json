The number <br/>of children needing homes is outrageous, and our ability as Americans to help the <br/>crisis should not be hindered by fees and financial struggle. We have enough <br/>issues in our country with debt that we should not force good hearted and well <br/>intentioned persons to incur further debt to rescue a child from an orphanage in a <br/>destitute country. Why would we make it harder for someone to save a life? The <br/>idea of raising fees (especially at this rate) is ludicrous. Please make one <br/>decision that will save lives all over the world. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a604", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:50:08Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T12:50:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Carissa M", "trackingNbr": "8021a604", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1813/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1813/attachments"}}}}}
