Our international adoption process is <br/>unfortunately taking a lot longer and therefore, according to your expiration timeframe, we&#39;ll need to <br/>reapply for approval. This is not only seems like a waste of our time and money, but it&#39;s wasting <br/>YOUR time and money...likely affecting the need to increase these fees. Therefore, I strongly urge <br/>you to not increase these fees and allow for a longer approval timeframe. This longer timeframe (24 <br/>months) is already being reviewed and considered in the House, H.R 628.
