We <br/>have already submitted all paperwork required and paid all applicable fees.  <br/>However, we are going to be forced to renew this paperwork due to the 18 month <br/>expiration of the paperwork.<br/><br/>We understand that the paperwork should expire, however, we would like to <br/>propose that you have a &quot;renewal&quot; fee, which would be much lower than the initial <br/>fee, for such paperwork.  The reason for a lower fee is that the labor for processing <br/>renewed paperwork should be much lower than the initial process.  Also, is there <br/>any way to extend the expiration period for fingerprints?  One year seems <br/>somewhat restrictive.<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to comment.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fcff8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-08T19:20:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-08T02:46:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Chris Gulley", "trackingNbr": "801fcff8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0246/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0246/attachments"}}}}}
