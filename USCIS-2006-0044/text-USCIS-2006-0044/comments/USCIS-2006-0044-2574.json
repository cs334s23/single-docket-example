This makes the 2nd increase in two <br/>years and unfairly places a greater burden on adoptive parents. <br/><br/>This proposal for increases claims that with the extra money received the USCIS <br/>will decrease wait times 20% by 2009 for 4 documents, none of which apply to <br/>international adoptions. Why then, does the CIS propose to make those seeking <br/>to adopt internationally pay for these improvements when it does not aid or help in <br/>reducing the wait time for international adoption paperwork? <br/><br/>This proposed increase unfairly targets adoptive families who will receive no <br/>benefit. As it stands now, those of us adopting from China will have file our I-600a <br/>twice and get re-fingerprinted, already a waste of money since we have been <br/>through the process once. CIS should propose the second filing be eliminated as <br/>it would reduce repetitive paperwork. Instead, they are proposing that we pay more <br/>for something that we have already received and been approved for.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de32", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:07:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T20:32:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Shannon Chambers", "trackingNbr": "8021de32", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2574/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2574/attachments"}}}}}
