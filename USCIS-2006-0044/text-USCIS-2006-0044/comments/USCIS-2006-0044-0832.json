I am very much <br/>opposed to this.  Because of the length of time for referrals for adoption from <br/>countries such as China, families will be required to resubmitt paperwork.  This is <br/>an additional financial burden. I don&#39;t think the raising of fees is justified, <br/>considering the electronic age we now live in makes background checks, <br/>fingerprinting etc. that much easier.<br/>Please be considerate of those families required to use this system in their <br/>adoption process and not make the already astronomical fees higher.<br/> A system should be put into place whereby applications that must be refiled in an <br/>18 month period of time pay only 1/2 the original fee.  <br/><br/>Carol<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020a877", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-23T19:03:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-23T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-22T15:56:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Carol J.
