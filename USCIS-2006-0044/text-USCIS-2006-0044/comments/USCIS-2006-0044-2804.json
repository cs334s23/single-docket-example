Adoption is already <br/>expensive and we pay many fees for processing of paperwork.  It is unfair to these <br/>families to make one more increase in their adoption process.  Keeping the fees at <br/>their current rate is much more mangeable for families to process the N-600, <br/>especially if they have multiple adoptions.  Please see the side of the families and <br/>do not increase the fee!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021eeeb", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:03:07Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T18:36:13Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Rachelle Pechacek", "trackingNbr": "8021eeeb", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2804/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2804/attachments"}}}}}
