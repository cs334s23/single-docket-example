Biometrics (fingerprints) from $70 to $80 per person, and <br/>2.) the I-600A from $545 to $670. <br/><br/>Our family is in the process of adopting a child from China.  Due to the long <br/>delays, we will no doubt be required to re-file our I-600A to get a new I-171H.<br/><br/>Adoption is a long process that involves great expense.  To increase the fees <br/>would present a real hardship for people that have already invested so much of <br/>themselves both emotionally and financially.<br/><br/>I urge you to please NOT increase these fees!!!<br/><br/>Thank you for your time &amp; consideration.<br/> <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021302c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T16:44:36Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-12T20:48:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Debbie J.
