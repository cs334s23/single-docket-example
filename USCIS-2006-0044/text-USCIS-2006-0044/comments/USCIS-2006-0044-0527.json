My <br/>youngest child is adopted, and the expense of adoption is high which limits many <br/>would be parents who would raise productive and loyal American citizens in their <br/>ability to adopt.  Unfortunately, for those of us who are currently persuing an <br/>adoption from China, this form has to be filed twice because the referral times are <br/>taking so long at this time.  In refiling this form, most adoptive parents also have <br/>to update their homestudies including criminal records checks and various other <br/>costly documents further increasing their fees.  At this time I think an increase in <br/>this fee would unfairly penalize those parents caught in a long wait that is out of <br/>their control by requiring great additional expense.  Adoption is expensive, and <br/>many parents walk into parenting an adoptive child with loans they wouldn&#39;t <br/>otherwise have and then have the increased expense of child care and medical <br/>tests and procedures.  Anything that can be done to keep these expenses down <br/>is most appreciated in this special community.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207ed9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T19:39:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T23:21:01Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tamara Page", "trackingNbr": "80207ed9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0527/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0527/attachments"}}}}}
