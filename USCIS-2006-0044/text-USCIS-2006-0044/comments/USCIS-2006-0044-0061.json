Please understand that it is not only<br/>aliens that must bear the burden of such high fees but often their U.S. citizen<br/>family members as well.  The anticipated benefits of such dramatic fee increases<br/>simply will not outweigh the hardship caused to American families.  If filing<br/>fees must be increased, it should be done so in a more modest fashion and with<br/>significant consideration of the circumstances of those paying the fees.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f99a4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T15:52:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-01T22:19:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michael Grim", "trackingNbr": "801f99a4", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0061/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0061/attachments"}}}}}
