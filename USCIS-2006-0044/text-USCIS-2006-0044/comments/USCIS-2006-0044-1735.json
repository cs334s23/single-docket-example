Families seeking <br/>adoption are already charged tens of thousands of dollars - all for a service that <br/>rescues orphan children and gives them oportunity for a better life.  The CIS <br/>service is already cumbersome, in that it is only valid for 18 months yet it is the <br/>first document due!  Many families end up paying this fee twice.  Stop being a <br/>bureaucrat for just long enough to realize how hard American families are working <br/>to adopt a child that in all likelyhood they are unable to have on their own.  These <br/>prices should not be monopolistic, with the government able to set the price due <br/>to the fact there are no other options for adopting a foreign child.  The child we are <br/>striving to adopt will be a hard-working, patriotic, tax paying citizen.  Evaluate the <br/>lifetime value of this and I am sure you will reconsider this increase.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Chris and Jessica Thomas<br/>U.S. Citizens<br/>International Adoption Applicants <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219fbe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T23:19:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T22:13:35Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "N/A", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Chris D.
