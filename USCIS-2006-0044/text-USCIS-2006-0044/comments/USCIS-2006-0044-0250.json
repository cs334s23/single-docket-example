Every immigration attorney and their clients can testify that <br/>immigration application is a long, stressful and frustrating process. For instance, <br/>After PERM is in place, time needed for labor certification is shortened, but the <br/>saved time is more than consumed by the long waiting period for I-485 submission <br/>because visa bulletin has replaced LC as the bottleneck. I understand there is <br/>quota constraint (for Chinese and Indians) here, but I can not help wondering if the <br/>authority can do a better job streamlining the process of handling applications in <br/>the pipeline.  What percentage of increase in efficiency are immigration officials <br/>committed to making within their power to improve their services for the public <br/>while they ask for an average of 66% increase in fees? This is the question for <br/>which I do want to <br/>have an answer from you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801fd9f4", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-08T19:32:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-08T14:31:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Hamlet Hua", "trackingNbr": "801fd9f4", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0250/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0250/attachments"}}}}}
