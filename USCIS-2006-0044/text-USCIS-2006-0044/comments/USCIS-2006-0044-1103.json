My friends and I have done Master in US and would like<br/>to settle down here. <br/>My position on this proposed rule is one of hearty approval. <br/>1. For the wonderful service that you provide I sometimes wonder how an<br/>organization could do that with the limited fees that you charge. <br/>2. I think that its a privilege for the immigrants to come to this country. I<br/>woudnt want you to get funding from the tax payers money as its not right for<br/>the tax payers to foot the bill for non citizens aspiring to come to this country. <br/>3. With this additional fees I am sure that you will provide a better service to<br/>the potential immigrants, as you are the first US agency that they come in<br/>contact with and I would like them to have a good first impression of this great<br/>country. <br/><br/>For this above reasons I wish you the best of luck in getting this rule approved.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480210f7b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T18:52:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-09T15:46:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Gaurau Girish", "trackingNbr": "80210f7b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1103/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1103/attachments"}}}}}
