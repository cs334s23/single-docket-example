With the I600a expiring in 18 months and the fingerprints expiring after only <br/>15 months, that means many prospective adoptive parents will have to pay those <br/>fees twice. That means it?s not $125 increase for the I600a, but really a $250 <br/>increase. And the fingerprints will cost people $160, not just $80.  The result of <br/>these exhorbatant fees is the USCIS is in essence pressuring prospective <br/>adopters to chose the ?faster? programs over those that may be more established <br/>and stable. Why are people punished just because they have a longer wait?  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a301", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:49:19Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T06:41:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Christina Chronister", "trackingNbr": "8021a301", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1804/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1804/attachments"}}}}}
