We are already spending $20,000+ for <br/>the privilege of expanding our families, and adding to that cost is placing an extra <br/>burden on families. We have spent, and continue to spend, months in emotional <br/>turmoil as we await our children. An increase in fees would add to that turmoil and <br/>increase the financial burden on families already stretched to the breaking point. <br/>Please do not increase the fees for the paperwork to bring our long-awaited <br/>children home.
