Because<br/>of this extensive wait we are certain to have to renew our fingerprints and<br/>I600A paperwork which will result in yet another unplanned adoption expense.  To<br/>date we have invested (financed) nearly $10,000 in the adoption process and<br/>won&#39;t be able to recover any of these funds until our adoption has been<br/>finalized.  Since it is likely to be nearly 2 years from now you can imagine<br/>that the idea of having to carry this debt all-the-while incurring new expenses<br/>is a source of financial stress on our family.  The fact that we will have to<br/>renew our immigration paperwork in the first place and having to pay the<br/>additional $685 promises to only compound this stress.  The prospect of these<br/>fees being increased to $830 (an increase of nearly 22 percent) seems incredible.  <br/><br/>While we certainly understand that fees must sometimes be increased, it would<br/>seem appropriate to implement a tier-based system that would alleviate some of<br/>the financial burden from adopting families.  For example:  first time<br/>applicants would pay the new fees of $670 plus $80 for fingerprints per person<br/>but applicants who were originally processed under the &quot;old&quot; fee schedule but<br/>who are forced to have to renew these documents because of extensive wait times<br/>would pay a reduced &quot;renewal&quot; fee.<br/><br/>Adoption is a lengthy and costly process and one that many qualified families<br/>already shy away from because of the high costs.  Please don&#39;t add to this<br/>problem by making your fees so high that average American?s can?t afford them. <br/>Thank you for taking my comments into consideration when making your decision.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cfad", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:51:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T19:22:14Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Joe Donnelly", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kathleen Cybulski", "trackingNbr": "8021cfad", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2420/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2420/attachments"}}}}}
