I do <br/>not agree with the increase as international adoption is very expensive.  The <br/>proposed increase is outrageous!  I think a 4-5% increase would be acceptable <br/>only if the length of the application and biometrics is extended.  We currently have <br/>to pay for the biometrics again because our finger prints will expire prior to us <br/>bringing our son home.  The application and biometrics should both be a minimum <br/>of 18 months, 24 months would be even better considering the adoption process <br/>can be a lengthy one.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219de6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T15:37:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:47:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Kris Drexler", "trackingNbr": "80219de6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1672/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1672/attachments"}}}}}
