It is very important for the Government to understand the financial<br/>hardships placed on a family before, during and after an adoption. My husband<br/>and I started out upper income family with a nice savings a house and pleasant<br/>success. After our second daughter arrived home, six months after our adoption,<br/>we had lost nearly everything financially and unexpectedly-- although I would<br/>not hesitate to do it all over again, because the children around the world need<br/>families like us, they need hope.<br/><br/>Because of political chaos and my daughter being born in a country other than<br/>Ukraine (Russia) she had to spend six months abandoned by the U.S., her new<br/>home, her country of Ukraine and her birth country. She was not legally allowed<br/>in the U.S. for lack of a birth certificate Russia refused to provide and was<br/>not allowed to stay in the orphanage because she had been legally adopted. We<br/>were made to pay a private nanny for her stay.<br/><br/>During the time in between I was terminated from my job for my extended stay of<br/>5 weeks in Ukraine and NOT covered by FMLA with NO protection from our<br/>government. As the year progressed we went from stable to near bankrupt from the<br/>steep adoption feed to unthinkable expenses to reunite our family on little to<br/>no income and no protection..<br/><br/>I am writing you today, not for pity but for advocacy for the children. It is<br/>hard enough to find funds to adopt for most families and I think back to the<br/>days when we weren&#39;t bothered by the expenses and were &quot;better off&quot; and wonder<br/>what would have been if the fees were written as they were. With international<br/>governments and the RADA now causing steep inclines in the cost of adoptions in<br/>every facet, I must plead that you don&#39;t impose unreasonable and steep rate<br/>increases. These are families and the loss of potential children&#39;s hope.<br/><br/>Please take a moment to focus on the real problems with immigration practices<br/>and issues within our government that allow families to lose their jobs for<br/>adopting children?<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Shelley Schadowsky<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a042", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:03:25Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:23:18Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous Shelley Schadowsky", "trackingNbr": "8021a042", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1755/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1755/attachments"}}}}}
