And with the increased <br/>wait time, we are seeing the reality of having to renew our documents with the <br/>USCIS because our paperwork is expiring.  I feel that it is unfair to adoptive <br/>families to have to renew our I-171H and our fingerprints because of the wait time <br/>increasing in China.  In all reality a person&#39;s fingerprints do not change after they <br/>are fingerprinted.  So why is it necessary to waste your time and mine to get re-<br/>fingerprinted?  I hope that you can keep the fees where they are until we (adoptive <br/>parents) can be granted the opportunity to extend the validity of our I-171H &amp; <br/>fingerprints with the bill trying to be passed in Congress right now.  Once the <br/>expiration is extended for these two important parts of our process, then we won&#39;t <br/>have to be renewing both of them a second and sometimes a third time.  Overall it <br/>is more costly for everyone involved.<br/> <br/>Please hear all those adoptive parents out there and their pleas for the fees to <br/>stay the same.  With the wait time increasing, that puts more costs to the family <br/>for their adoption expenses.  Adoption still needs to be a wonderful alternative to <br/>those who cannot have children.  The more expensive it gets, the less families <br/>there will be to adopt those children who do not have a family or a home.  Please <br/>keep our costs down so we can bring those children home to wonderful families.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ceci Gray<br/>2974 Rawley Pike<br/>Harrisonburg, VA  22801<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dd79", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T17:59:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T18:26:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ceci Gray", "trackingNbr": "8021dd79", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2558/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2558/attachments"}}}}}
