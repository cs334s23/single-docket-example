It is very frustrating <br/>that the wait is so long, it is more frustating tht we have to file a new I600A and <br/>submit more fingerprints, and it is most frustating that you are raising the FEE!  <br/><br/>I do not understand the reason for the &quot;18 month life&quot; of the I600A for adoptive <br/>parents.  I do not understand why an extention can not be filed when we are <br/>obviously still waiting for the baby which is the whole purpose for us obtaining  the <br/>I600A in the first place.   <br/><br/>Please do not raise the already high fees.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021cf87", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T23:50:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T19:10:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent, Amy Clark", "trackingNbr": "8021cf87", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2412/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2412/attachments"}}}}}
