We will already have to pay to refile for our I171 <br/>and also be refingerprinted.  The increased fees will be another additional  cost <br/>that we did not forsee when we started our second adoption from China.  Our <br/>government should assist us during a difficult process instead of adding to the <br/>stress of internation adoption.  If domestic adoption were a certainity we would <br/>have attempted that route to become parents, but unfortunately that has not <br/>worked out for most families who have attempted domestic adoption.  I implore <br/>you to assist familes who have already struggled with the emotional and financial <br/>straits of infertility.  Please due not increase the fees for fingerprinting and I171s.  <br/>Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Shirley Baumann<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020931f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:45:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-17T00:29:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Senator Hilary Clinton", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Shirley J.
