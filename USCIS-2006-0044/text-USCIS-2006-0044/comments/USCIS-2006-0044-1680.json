As an adoptive parent I am writing to voice my opinions on the proposed <br/>increase in fees for the I-600a application.  As adoptive parents we have many <br/>fees to incur.  This increase in fees will simply make it that much more difficult to <br/>bring our children home.  Also, with the increase in wait times for many countries <br/>we are having to submit our I-600a froms twice, which is already increasing our <br/>fees, to increase the fee on top of that would make it even more difficult.  <br/><br/>Thank You for listening and please consider the heartache that adoptive parents <br/>go through in trying to bring their children home.  It does not need to be added to <br/>by adding more fees.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Michelle Green<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e08", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:33:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T19:57:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michelle L.
