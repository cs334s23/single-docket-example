We who are involved in the middle of an <br/>adoption process are having to pay this double pricing due to the expiration <br/>dates.  I am pleading that would you reconsider not raising the pricing as well as <br/>please extend the expiration dates on the form and fingerprinting process.  <br/>Adoption is very expensive in itself, why does the Home / Land / Immigration <br/>Security have to be so hard and financially draining upon us? Especially when my <br/>husband is in the military and has a top secret permit.
