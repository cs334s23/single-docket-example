If UCSS itself fails to comply with the law,  what<br/>message does it send?<br/><br/>I understand that one of the reasons stated for fee increase is<br/>improving customer service and reducing backlogs.   <br/>Past experience with UCSS in this regard is quite dissappointing.<br/><br/>I suggest the following:<br/><br/>If the UCSS completes processing within the timeframe, it keeps<br/>the fee, or else it should return the processing fee (or at least<br/>a fraction of it).  I think UCSS is currently doing this for premium processing.<br/>I think that should be extended to ALL processing.<br/><br/>I oppose any fee increase that is not tied to improvement in service.  <br/><br/>Respectfully Submiited.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480205835", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-14T18:45:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-14T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-14T00:47:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80205835", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0357/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0357/attachments"}}}}}
