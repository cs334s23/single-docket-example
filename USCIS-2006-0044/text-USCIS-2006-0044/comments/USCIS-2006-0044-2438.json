Adoption is already a very <br/>expensive process for those seeking to provide a loving home to orphans.  The <br/>proposed fee increases would be overly burdensome to those seeking to provide a <br/>home to orphans.<br/>Frequently, adoptive parents must file TWICE because the overseas processes <br/>take longer than the 18 months the forms are valid.  A solution would be to <br/>PERMIT RENEWAL without charging another fee.<br/><br/>Here is what it costs a couple to file with USCIS just to adopt:<br/>What it used to be:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I600A: $545<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer (file twice) plus the increase in <br/>fees:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 (over 140%!)   This does not even take into account the <br/>fact that applying for our child&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) goes from <br/>$215 to $460, a difference of $245 (about 120% increase). <br/><br/>Please help us to reach out to orphans in love without overly burdensome fees!<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration,<br/>Roberto and Laura V.<br/>Adoptive parents<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d719", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:17:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T21:43:31Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adoptive Parent, Roberto and Lau Vazquez", "trackingNbr": "8021d719", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2438/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2438/attachments"}}}}}
