Everyone understands that prices go up.  However, one increase of over <br/>65% is very high.  It seems that our government is talking out of both sides of their <br/>mouth.  Allowing a $10,000 tax credit for adoptions but then proposing to increase <br/>the rates for filing and forms by over 65% is taking away from that generous tax <br/>credit.  Adoption is a blessing for all involved.  Families able to grow by opening <br/>their hearts and their homes and children being able to grow into responsible, <br/>thriving adults who will contribute to make a better society.  The alternative of <br/>adoption is orphanages and foster care that again takes money away from the <br/>government to fund these programs.  So why penalize the people who are trying to <br/>provide a home for these children by increasing their fess by over 65%?  This <br/>rational is not understandable and doesn&#39;t make good sense to a business <br/>person.  The idea that this has been proposed is crazy but what is much more <br/>unimaginable is that this could actually happen.  Please, consider all of the <br/>consequences when you look at passing this increase.  Isn&#39;t there somewhere <br/>else you can increase prices and leave the adoption rates alone.  Aren&#39;t the costs <br/>for adoption already too high?  Aren&#39;t we helping the economy by taking on the <br/>burden of providing for a child that has been abandoned or relinquished up to the <br/>government to take care of?  Don&#39;t penalize us and make it even harder for families <br/>to adopt.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b36c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T00:44:27Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T14:30:05Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Nancy N.
