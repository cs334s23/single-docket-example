Families adopting internationally are <br/>already having to re-file the documents that are required because of the increased <br/>wait time associated with international adoption. We are currently paying double <br/>the intended fee because of this.  If any changes should be considered to the <br/>current process, especially those associated with adoption, it should be to <br/>increase the time the filed documents are valid because 12 months is NOT long <br/>enough and does not correspond with the current wait time on many international <br/>adoptions.<br/><br/>Families adopting internationally are already spending a considerable amount of <br/>money and raising the cost of the filing fees would only cause more frustration and <br/>heartbreak.
