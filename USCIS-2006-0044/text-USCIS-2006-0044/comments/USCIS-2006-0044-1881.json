We have been <br/>made aware that there is a proposal  to increase  the fees of the immigration <br/>servcies.  We are aware that at some point, fees need to increase but the <br/>increase is too much at one time.  Adoption itself is an expensive process and <br/>then to add more money for immigration puts an increased burden on those of us <br/>trying to have a family.  Sometimes, families end up paying the fee twice because <br/>the paperwork has expired before an adoption is complete. Will the increased fees <br/>also increase the amount of time the document is good for? Maybe if you just <br/>increased the time the documents were good for than you wouldn&#39;t have so many <br/>applications.  The adoption process takes a long time and the immigration <br/>paperwork so allow for the process to complete in a timely manner.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a92f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:57:19Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T18:39:52Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021a92f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1881/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1881/attachments"}}}}}
