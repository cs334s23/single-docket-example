The rich will continue to adopt while lower income families looe the ability <br/>to adopt internationally.  Further, international adoption is a positive action that demonstrates the <br/>charity and character of the american people at a time when we could use the positive press.  <br/>Please vote against the increases.  Please help make international adoption available to the people <br/>of this great country who want to raise adopted children, regardless of the parents income level.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Chris Braun<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e321", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:53:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T13:54:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Christopher Braun", "trackingNbr": "8021e321", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2640/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2640/attachments"}}}}}
