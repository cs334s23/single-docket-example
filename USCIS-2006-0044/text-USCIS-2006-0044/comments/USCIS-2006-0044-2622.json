I have also heard the Certificate of Citizenship <br/>fee will also be increased. If you add these increases to nearly cost-prohibitive <br/>fees from adoption agencies and fees the foreign countries charge, some people <br/>are either not going to be able to become parents, or, as my family has done, go <br/>into more debt than we can afford. Not every adoptive parent is well-off financially, <br/>and a lot of adult immigrants and their families are barely making mimimum wage.<br/><br/>Immigrants want to &quot;live the American dream.&quot; Prospective adoptive parents do <br/>too--to raise a family.  Increasing these fees will only make these dreams more <br/>impossible for some.  And wasn&#39;t it said by Emma Lazarus about welcoming &quot;the <br/>huddled masses yearning to be free&quot;?<br/><br/>I urge you to not make these proposed increases, as it will not only negatively <br/>impact persons wanting to be citizens, but also current citizens.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and attention.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mary Feagley<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021e097", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:05:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T04:42:57Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Mary Feagley", "trackingNbr": "8021e097", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2622/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2622/attachments"}}}}}
