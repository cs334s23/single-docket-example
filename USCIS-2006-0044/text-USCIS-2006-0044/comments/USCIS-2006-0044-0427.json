I&#39;m sure you already know how expensive adoption can be. It can <br/>also understand the cost of your services need to be raised a bit. The fingerprint <br/>increase seems reasonable, but not for the application and petition services. <br/><br/>If the rates positively needed to be increased, it would be extremely helpful if you <br/>could lower the rates, or even more helpful, extend the I-171 for those of us that <br/>have to wait a bit longer. <br/><br/>Adoption is not an easy process. It is very taxing on everyone involved. It can be <br/>very stressful and emotional for even a short adoption wait. It would be GREATLY <br/>appreciated if our own government would be able to help these families go through <br/>this transition with help and assistance, rather then feel like they have to go it <br/>alone. Though it is difficult to have to wait to start our family, it could be made <br/>much more bearable if the I-171 could be extended for those of us that need it. If <br/>that were possible then I would approve a raise in the cost of the <br/>application/petition fee. Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Michelle Edwards<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206bff", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T01:28:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T01:30:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michelle Edwards", "trackingNbr": "80206bff", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0427/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0427/attachments"}}}}}
