As part of a couple in the middle of adoption <br/>paperwork, this is distressing news. The cost of international adoption is already <br/>quite a burden, and I hope that these proposed rate increases will be <br/>reconsidered. Specifically, we are adopting from China, and with its lengthy wait <br/>process, we will have to file the I-600A and get fingerprinted not once, but twice, <br/>so families in our situation would be doubly burdened by the increases. I can only <br/>speak from the adoption perspective, and I realize that there are many other <br/>groups who use this form and the biometrics service. The proposed rate increases <br/>would serve only to further financially burden citizens.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020bd61", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-28T16:12:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-27T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-26T21:51:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Amy M.
