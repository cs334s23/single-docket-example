Adoption is so expensive<br/>already.  Increased fees will make it that much more difficult for parents to<br/>adopt.  Increased wait times because of increased adoption oversight (i.e Hague<br/>convention) results in parents having to go through burdensome governmental<br/>procedures more often and to pay fees multiple times.  For example, the I-600A<br/>fee must be paid and then paid again when the adoption has not finalized within<br/>18 months (which will probably happen in our own adoption).  The same is true<br/>for fingerprinting which must be done multiple times even though fingerprints of<br/>an applicant never change.  Adoption is very important and beneficial aspect of<br/>our U.S. society and should not be discouraged.  Thank you for your<br/>consideration of this most important matter!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef26", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:03:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T18:55:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anne Moran", "trackingNbr": "8021ef26", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2811/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2811/attachments"}}}}}
