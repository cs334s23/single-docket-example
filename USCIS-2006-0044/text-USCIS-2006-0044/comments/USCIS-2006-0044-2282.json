That&#39;s an increase of $975 for the I600A <br/>and required fingerprints--an intolerable burden on people who are already <br/>financially maxxed out trying to adopt.<br/><br/>I&#39;m also complaining about the proposed increase in the application fee for the <br/>Certificate of Citizenship. A $245 increase is, again, unconscionable. These are <br/>the children of American citizens, and we should not be engaging in price gouging <br/>for these financially stressed families.<br/><br/>I urge you to hold the line on fees for adoptive families.
