Now there is a proposed increase???<br/>Why does it cost $500 and up for an application of orphan status petition?<br/>1.What is the work involved in approving these papers that can JUSTIFY the cost?<br/>I think the thinking behind this is that adoption is already expensive,<br/>prospective parents who want their children home would not mind another few<br/>hundreds dollars?  <br/>But that is putting an unnecessary and unfair burden on adopting parents, they<br/>already have to save and spare everything they could to adopt a kid.
