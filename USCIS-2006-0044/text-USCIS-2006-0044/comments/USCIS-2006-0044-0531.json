Even <br/>the poorest families in the US have much higher standards of living than children <br/>in developing nations. Adopting abandoned and orphaned children into American <br/>families is only a small fulfillment of our obligation to these nations, many for <br/>which our foreign policies and exploitative business practices have fostered <br/>conditions of poverty.<br/><br/>Therefore, please do not further penalize the children and adults of these nations <br/>by creating more economic hardship for those trying to offer them a second <br/>chance.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Shellie Ellis<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207efe", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T19:45:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T23:38:36Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Brad Miller", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Shellie Ellis", "trackingNbr": "80207efe", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0531/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0531/attachments"}}}}}
