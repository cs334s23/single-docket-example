I <br/>suggest a small fee increase of 5% and an increase in the length of time that the I-<br/>600A and fingerprints are valid for both new applications and existing documents. <br/><br/>The current international timelines for adoption are increasing.  We recently had to <br/>have our fingerprints redone requiring an additional fee.  Our I-600A most likely will <br/>also need to be updated with an additional fee submitted.<br/><br/>A modest increase in fees and an increase in the timeframe these documents are <br/>valid would assist adoptive parents financially and reduce your agency&#39;s related <br/>workload.<br/><br/>Thank you for for considering my comments.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021db9c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:19:29Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T12:58:46Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021db9c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2511/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2511/attachments"}}}}}
