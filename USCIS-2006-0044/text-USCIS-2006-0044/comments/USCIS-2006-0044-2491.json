Due to the lenghthy process <br/>that it takes China to complete an adoption (at present it is 18 months approx.), <br/>those adopting are now being required to reapply for their I600A and other <br/>documentation as we approach the 17 month mark.  <br/><br/>The cost of the USCIS application is already a significant cost to us adopting and <br/>because it only is valid for 18 months, most people adopting from China can <br/>anticipate having to reapply their I600A.  With the new proposal increasing the <br/>price, I ask that the price either not be increased, since this will be a significant <br/>cost to those already trying to scrape together the $13,000+  it cost to adopt, or <br/>that those adopting be able to renew their I600A for 0 costs or at a reduced cost.<br/><br/>Here is what it costs to file with USCIS for a couple just to adopt when adoptions <br/>took place within 18 months:<br/><br/>I600A: $545<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $70 x 2 = $140<br/><br/>Total: $685<br/><br/>What it will be now that adoptions are taking longer plus the increase:<br/><br/>I600A: $670 x 2 = $1340<br/><br/>Fingerprints: $80 x 4 = $ 320<br/><br/>Total: $1660<br/><br/>That&#39;s an increase of $975 or over 140% and we receive with no increase in <br/>services or a speedier turn-around.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s not even taking into consideration the fact that applying for our<br/>children&#39;s Certificate of Citizenship (for IR4 visas) goes from $215 to<br/>$460, a difference of $245 or about 120% increase. Sometimes, we don&#39;t even<br/>get the certificates for a year after filing!<br/><br/>Thank you for hearing my concern/complaint and I appreciate your consideration.  <br/>With such increased costs, many children will not be able to be adopted from <br/>China and other countries that take longer than 18 months to complete an <br/>adoption.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, my experience at the immigration office in Yakima was a <br/>very postive experience.  The staff was professional, friendly and helpful.  I think <br/>they did an amazing job and represent our government very well.<br/><br/>Frances M Zembal<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021da09", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:17:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T07:20:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Frances Zemball", "trackingNbr": "8021da09", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2491/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2491/attachments"}}}}}
