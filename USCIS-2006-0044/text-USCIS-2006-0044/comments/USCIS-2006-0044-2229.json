These people who are wanting to <br/>adopt are our daughter and son in law and they are the ones working their tails off <br/>to get everything ready, filled out, and into the proper places.  It has been at least <br/>five months and they are no where.  I suggest you take the money already alotted <br/>and hire some competent people or computer programs to speed up the process.  <br/>I also suggest that you take $500 of the $545 and give back to the people wanting <br/>to adopt to spend on the child when they get her.  It would be better spent.<br/>Please don&#39;t raise the fee, it already costs an arm and a leg.<br/>Thanks for your consideration in this matter.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c292", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:45:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T18:31:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Adell Lovell", "trackingNbr": "8021c292", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2229/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2229/attachments"}}}}}
