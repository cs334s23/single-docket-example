Due to the <br/>longer timelines to adopt, particularly from China, these forms expire before the <br/>adoption is completed and most of us are having to renew our application and pay <br/>again.  International adoption is expensive as it is, and when you have to already pay <br/>twice, these costs can add up.  Please consider extending the timelines in the 171 <br/>before upping the price.  Perhaps the reason you are having to handle so many of <br/>these applications is because we are having to do them twice.  If you extend the <br/>deadline, there will be less work on your part.  Upping the price is a lousy answer for <br/>those of us who have already had to pay once.  Thank you for your time.
