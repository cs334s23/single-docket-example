I am a parent of internationally adopted child.  <br/>We pay a ton of fees during our adoption process.  These fees are one of many <br/>additional fees we have to pay.  International adoption is already too expensive for <br/>most people, and this will make it even worse.  Some of the increases are huge ie <br/>80%. I am all for getting more effeciency in the USCIS office but I&#39;m not sure this <br/>is the way to make it happen.  Why not find another source of money. This fee <br/>increase is very disappointing. <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f03b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:51Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T20:49:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sylvia Burton", "trackingNbr": "8021f03b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2847/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2847/attachments"}}}}}
