I personally work with refugees who have been invited <br/>to live in this country legally.  They are at a great disadvantage in the work force in <br/>terms of the wages they are able to receive.  All of the refugees I work with are <br/>living at or below poverty levels even though they are working and paying taxes.  <br/>The extreme hike in fees for them to acquire green cards and to become citizens <br/>will impose tremendous hardships on these families.  For many this hike in fees <br/>with cost them their ability to become citizens.  A different method of financing for <br/>this service is required in order to allow these families, who have been invited to <br/>move to Utah, to fulfill their ability to follow through with their desires to become <br/>full citizens of this country.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef9d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:37:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Yda Smith", "trackingNbr": "8021ef9d", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2830/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2830/attachments"}}}}}
