We have already filed an I-600a at a <br/>total cost of $685. Because of changes in adoption timelines, it is very <br/>unlikely that our adoption will be completed before our I-171H expires at 18 <br/>months. Since there is no way to renew an I-171H (a separate complaint), we <br/>will have to file another I-600a to bring our daughter home at a cost of an <br/>additional $685 (at current fee rates). If fees are allowed to increase as <br/>proposed, that filing will cost another $830. We make $32,500 per year before <br/>taxes. $1,515 is an unreasonable price to demand for the privilege of possibly <br/>being allowed to pay more money to obtain a visa for our daughter at some <br/>point in the distant future.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, our son was never sent a Certificate of Citizenship <br/>despite becoming an automatic citizen in 2002. We have given up on that wrong <br/>being righted and will have to file for one, then likely wait a year to a year <br/>and a half for it to arrive after our check has been cashed. Currently, that <br/>check would read $255. Under your proposed fee increases, the charge would be <br/>$460; for a document which he should have been sent (as our daughter?s will) <br/>as part of services for which we have already paid. This is completely <br/>unreasonable.<br/><br/>Please do not make these already exorbitant fees even more unreasonable. We <br/>are struggling to pay the fees as they already exist. Don?t make this even <br/>harder on our families.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>The Hatherall family<br/>Geneseo, New York<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f0ef", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:06:42Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T22:23:09Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021f0ef", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2862/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2862/attachments"}}}}}
