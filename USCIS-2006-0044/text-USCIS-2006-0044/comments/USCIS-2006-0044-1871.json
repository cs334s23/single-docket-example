While I understand that there<br/>is always a need to increase fees for certain documents annually as the cost of<br/>living increases.  I felt compelled to comment on your proposed increase of more<br/>than 60%.  Please take into consideration the exuberant costs that adoption<br/>already entails of which only small fraction is tax deductible.  Also, the fact<br/>of the matter is that most of these forms need to be completed two times in any<br/>adoption because an adoption usually is not finalized in the timeframe allotted.<br/> Most prospective adoptive parents have to pay for these fees two times.  I am<br/>asking that you please re-consider you increase in fees.  Your time and<br/>attention in this matter is greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Prospective adoptive parent,<br/>Grace Perez<br/>Andover, NJ <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a827", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T01:56:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T16:45:28Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Grace Perez", "trackingNbr": "8021a827", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1871/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1871/attachments"}}}}}
