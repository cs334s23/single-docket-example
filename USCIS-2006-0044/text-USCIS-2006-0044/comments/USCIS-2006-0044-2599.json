Second, I <br/>realize that the cost of processing these applications increase every year.  But for <br/>those of us who are adopting from China, this is a process we have to endure <br/>twice.  This is because of the length of time that is currently required. <br/><br/>Well, the increase in cost will stop no one from adopting, it is one more financial <br/>hurtle that must be over come.  A hurtle among many that continue to grow <br/>higher.  Most of us have already moved into financial areas that have and will have <br/>future constraints placed on our budgets.  But they are ones we will <br/>endure............<br/><br/>The pursuit of happiness.........That is all we seek.  What a wonderful idea.  A true <br/>theology to be proud.  Do we not also deserve the same compassion that other <br/>American parents receive?  As I have said, I understand the need to pay for <br/>government by those that use it.  But surely, a provision for those of us who have <br/>already paid once can be added.  <br/><br/>I am very satisfied with how the Northern Virginia office has handled every aspect <br/>of our paper work.  And do not begrudge them the fee.  But unlike others, those of <br/>us going to China leave the first application process with nothing to show for it.<br/><br/>I am a Virginia, my family has proudly lived here since 1674. My wife and I will <br/>never be able to have our own biological children. But we are looking forward to be <br/>able to call this child are own.  Adoptive children will require more attention, <br/>medical care and have more physical needs than biological children usually do.  <br/>All of these things takes time and money.  So well this may seem like a small <br/>hurtle, it may possible remove the means for a future need.. <br/><br/>Thanks to our government and the government of China we will be able to pursue <br/>happiness.  <br/><br/>Thank you again for your time,<br/><br/>John and Kathy Halvorsen<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021df46", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T01:04:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-01T00:25:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Randy Forbes", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by John Halvorsen", "trackingNbr": "8021df46", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2599/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2599/attachments"}}}}}
