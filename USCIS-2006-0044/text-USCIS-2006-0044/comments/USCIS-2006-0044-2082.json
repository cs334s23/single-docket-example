International<br/>adoption is very costly for families.  Children deserve to have families and the<br/>US Government should do everything in it&#39;s power to help that happen.  There are<br/>plenty of other immigration services that could be considered for fee increase.<br/> Most people come to america selfishly for a better lifestyle than they have in<br/>in their own country.  US citizens adopting abroad, however are giving<br/>selflessly for their adopted children to provide the love of a family.  <br/><br/>Please re-consider the increase of immigration fees for adoption.  By keeping<br/>these fees to a minimum you help make it possible for orphan children to find<br/>their forever families. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b8c1", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T23:45:03Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T02:54:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Cristine Brouillette", "trackingNbr": "8021b8c1", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2082/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2082/attachments"}}}}}
