I cannot see how an increase of 60% is necessary <br/>when we just had an increase in 2005 of 40%.  Cost of living has increased <br/>approximatly 3% per year that being said an increase of 6% at most should be <br/>sufficient, although at this point I think that is even too much.  I am sure there are <br/>other areas that can be down sized, maybe an outside source could come in and <br/>give suggestions on appropriate areas for downsizing.  You could have better info <br/>on internet so people do not have to talk to a representative which i am sure is <br/>costly.  The  frequently asked question section does not have enough answers, so <br/>unfortunately you have to talk to a live person.  I am against the increase <br/>proposed and hope you take my opinion into account before deciding to  this <br/>increase.<br/>Thank you a concerned citizen.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a0d5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:04:31Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T00:40:17Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Dawn", "trackingNbr": "8021a0d5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1768/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1768/attachments"}}}}}
