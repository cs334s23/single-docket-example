Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit<br/>Application and Petition Fee Schedule<br/><br/>To Whom it May Concern:<br/><br/>I write to strongly oppose the increase of immigration and naturalization fees<br/>that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) proposed on February<br/>1, 2007.  Every day immigrants and refugees already struggle to pay immigration<br/>fees.  The steep increases proposed by USCIS would make it much more difficult<br/>to gain permanent resident status, reunite with family members, and become a<br/>U.S. citizen.  USCIS should be helping immigrants become citizens, not making it<br/>harder.<br/><br/>USCIS claims that the fee increase is necessary to improve service, and USCIS<br/>definitely needs to improve service.  While I applaud USCIS?s efforts to improve<br/>service, I do not think that the entire cost should rest on immigrants who are<br/>already paying taxes, working hard, and struggling to pay high fees while<br/>receiving poor service.  <br/><br/>Immigration and citizenship are public goods that benefit our entire country and<br/>that we as a nation should help pay for.  Immigrants work hard, pay taxes, and<br/>help revitalize our communities.  In becoming citizens, immigrants demonstrate<br/>their strong commitment to their new home country by learning English, gaining<br/>knowledge about American history and government, and swearing allegiance to the<br/>United States.  We should be encouraging immigrants to become part of our<br/>community by gaining legal status and becoming citizens, not setting up barriers<br/>that block their path and keep them out.  <br/><br/>For all these reasons, I strongly oppose the proposed fee increases and urge<br/>USCIS to reconsider this proposal, and to seek other sources of funding for its<br/>operations, rather than add more burdens on immigrants.  Thank you for your<br/>consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Tinne Van Loon<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ee50", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:01:50Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T17:38:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tinne Van Loon", "trackingNbr": "8021ee50", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2791/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2791/attachments"}}}}}
