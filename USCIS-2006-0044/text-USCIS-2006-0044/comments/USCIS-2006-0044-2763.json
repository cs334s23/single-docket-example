As a couple currently working to adopt three orphans, <br/>we are well acquainted with the already substantial fees required by the U.S. <br/>Government to adopt orphaned children.<br/><br/>I feel that these significant increases will place extra hardship on families <br/>struggling to come up with the already hefty petition and documentation fees <br/>required.  These children wait in orphanages without hope and desperate for loving <br/>families.  It is unwise to penalize families with inflated fees who are compelled to <br/>adopt hurting children around the world.   <br/><br/>Orphaned children adopted into U.S. families are a very important component of <br/>our society.  They will not be a burden to our society but instead will prove to be a <br/>major asset to this nation.  As recipients of such love and compassion, these <br/>children will blossom, thrive and contribute greatly to this nation.  They will be <br/>outstanding, influential citizens who will work heartily for good.  These children will <br/>mature into the kind of citizens our nation needs.  The beneficial contributions that <br/>these children will make for future generations should compel the U.S. <br/>Government to not make it more financially burdensome to incorporate them into <br/>our families and society.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Thank you very much for your consideration,<br/><br/>Julie Armstrong <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ecf8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-03T14:26:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T15:20:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Julie Armstrong", "trackingNbr": "8021ecf8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2763/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2763/attachments"}}}}}
