I&#39;m<br/>writing as an adoptive parent of an international child, also in the process of<br/>adopting a second child from overseas. If you are going to increase these fees,<br/>then please at least increase the adoption tax credits at the same time. Or<br/>could you distinguish between adoption expenses and those of other types of<br/>immigrants? International adoption is a wonderful way to build a family and to<br/>strengthen international ties and good will, AND it&#39;s already expensive! The<br/>adoption-related expenses would be increased by more than 50% with this new<br/>proposal!
