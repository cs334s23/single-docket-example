As <br/>the adoption process gets longer for many countries, many waiting families are <br/>required to re-submit this form and pay the fee again (possibly up to 3x).  This is a <br/>legal form of extortion.  The first fee is paid so that a family&#39;s homestudy remains <br/>valid for a year, and then if the family wants to keep it valid, they must pay again.<br/><br/>I would recommend that if this fee is to be increased, then the validity of the form <br/>should remain in effect for a greater period of time.  Similarly, if the adoption tax <br/>credit were to be increased by $500-$1000 to offset this cost, this would be an <br/>amenable solution.<br/><br/>It doesn&#39;t bode well when anyone in this country can birth a child relatively <br/>inexpensively (to the family).  Additionally, many of these children are born out of <br/>wedlock and to low-income families (or single mothers) who lack motivation or <br/>incentive to be productive citizens in this country.  This cycle is self-perpetuating <br/>in many cases, so the pattern repeats itself for many generations.  Adoptive <br/>families make the conscious choice to build a family.  They are highly productive <br/>citizens of this country who are resourceful enough to raise a child who will be <br/>equally productive.  Why punish these individuals without an equal compensation <br/>for their sacrifice?<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d8b6", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:16:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T02:57:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Troy Brock", "trackingNbr": "8021d8b6", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2474/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2474/attachments"}}}}}
