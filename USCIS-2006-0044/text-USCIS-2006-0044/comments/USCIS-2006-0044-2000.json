I could understand a $20 to $50 <br/>increase but $125??  That&#39;s a huge increase, 23% I believe.  Due to the long wait <br/>for our adoption we will have to renew our forms and fingerprints, we will have to <br/>pay for this service again and now at a even greater expense.  If the US <br/>Immigration dept. needs more money to run their programs I don&#39;t think we should <br/>have to fund it straight from our pockets, we already pay taxes.  Thanks for your <br/>consideration in this matter.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ac9b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:15:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T02:45:37Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Tammy Beaird", "trackingNbr": "8021ac9b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2000/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2000/attachments"}}}}}
