I am not in favor of <br/>raising these fees.  The costs of adoption, domestically and internationally, is <br/>already so high that many families cannot pursue their dream of having a family <br/>through adoption. I believe that increasing these fees will further discourage many <br/>people from trying to adopt children that need loving homes and will cause further <br/>hardship on families that may have to repeat their paperwork due to lengthening <br/>wait times for referrals, including myself.  As it now stands, the I-171 form needed <br/>for international adoption expires in 18 months and many wait times from <br/>reputable adoption agencies is 18+ months which will mean that paperwork will <br/>need to re-done.  Also the biometrics needed expire within 15 months and again <br/>will have to be re-done.  So, in my case, what had cost me $755 in September will <br/>cost me $910 to have re-done.  I find this unacceptable.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Dana Moore<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021aae5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T12:57:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T22:10:06Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Dana L.
