The wait time for us to <br/>adopt a child from China is 18 months AFTER our paperwork arrives in China.  <br/>Unconditionally, as the law is now, we will have to refile for this form a second <br/>time!  This is obviously time consuming for not only the adoptive parents but our <br/>government employees!  We then have to pay all the necessary filing fees involved <br/>with obtaining a new I171 form adding up to hundreds of dollars (on top of an <br/>already horrendously expensive process).  Please consider the huge number of <br/>American adoptive parents who are already mentally, financially and often <br/>physically stressed from this international adoption process and make this step in <br/>the process a ONE step process.  Obtaining this form twice just doesn&#39;t make <br/>sense for anyone involved - the citizens or the government.
