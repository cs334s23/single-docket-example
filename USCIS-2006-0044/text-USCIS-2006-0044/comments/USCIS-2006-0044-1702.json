Even though becoming U.S. Citizen is very valuable for the <br/>immigrant, it is also valuable for the community, economically and culturally. <br/>Immigrants will pay their taxes and contribute to the community which will raise <br/>the overall well being of the country.<br/><br/>Furthermore, increasing the fees will also affect the adoption process. Adoptive <br/>parent have already a tremendous financial burden in finalizing the process. This <br/>increase will prevent more families to be prospective parents. There are many <br/>families who have everything to offer to an adoptive child, but don?t have the initial <br/>funding to adopt.<br/>Adoption benefit the society as the adoptive child will certainly pursue a high <br/>education and will contribute to higher income tax. Therefore, the government <br/>should encourage adoption instead of adding more financial charges.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219ebf", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:34:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:34:05Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Vincent Eppner", "trackingNbr": "80219ebf", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1702/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1702/attachments"}}}}}
