As my daughter, wife, and I wait for our <br/>daughter from China, we have had to be fingerprinted twice and submit our I-600A <br/>twice as well. It is expensive enough already to bring a new baby into our home; <br/>fee increases by a federal agency will only make that even more so. Perhaps the <br/>better solution to an increase in fees would be to increase the amount of time that <br/>fingerprints and the I-171-H are valid! That would mean fewer applications for the <br/>USCIS to handle and less expense for adoptive families. A win-win situation for <br/>both parties.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219f47", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T19:53:49Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T21:16:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Lawrence M.
