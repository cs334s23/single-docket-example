Due to the lengthy process, our original I-600A expired and we had to<br/>re-apply for this document.  Most countries require proof that the document has<br/>been accepted before they will even accept you into their program; since it is<br/>only good for 18 months, it is likely that a lot of people would have to pay for<br/>this twice.  This is one of the most expensive single documents you must<br/>complete when adopting, and raising the rate will only put more hardship on<br/>adoptive parents.  If the rate is raised, I think the length of time the document<br/>is good for should also be extended greatly, and anyone having to re-do the<br/>document due to expiration while waiting for their adoption to go through should<br/>receive a discounted rate.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021efee", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:46Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T20:10:49Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Erika Albin", "trackingNbr": "8021efee", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2843/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2843/attachments"}}}}}
