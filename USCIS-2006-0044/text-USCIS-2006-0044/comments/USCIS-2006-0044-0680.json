As an adoptive parent <br/>who is in the midst of this process, I request these fees NOT be increased.  The <br/>entire adoption process is extremely expensive and increasing these fees adds <br/>insult to injury.  Please make steps to make it easier to adoption orphaned <br/>abandoned children--not more difficult and costly.  Currently the regulations have <br/>the I-600 form expire after 18 months and the FBI fingerprints expire after 15 <br/>months.  The adoption process is often LONGER than these timelines.  Therefore <br/>as adoptive parents we have to file the I-600 and the FBI fingerprints AGAIN--along <br/>with paying those fees AGAIN.  Please lengthen the expiration dates on these <br/>pieces of paper.  These expiration dates set at 18 months and 15 months are <br/>probably arbitrary times.  I haven&#39;t found any employee who could explain why <br/>those expiration dates were set for those times.  Please, make adoption less <br/>paper-trail cumbersome.  Thank you for listening to my heart-felt plea.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480208d8a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-21T15:43:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-21T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-16T18:16:16Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sonda L.
