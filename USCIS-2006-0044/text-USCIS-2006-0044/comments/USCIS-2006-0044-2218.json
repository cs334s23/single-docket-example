My husband and I have completed this paperwork now <br/>TWICE for the adopton of a child in Russia.  Beyond our control, the Russian <br/>Government has held up the paperwork on reaccrediting foreign adoption agencies <br/>operating in Russia, thereby impacting the timeline of our adoption.  Because the <br/>adoption timeline from referral to final court date has taken over a year to <br/>complete, we have had to re-do all of our paperwork, including the I-600 <br/>application AND getting re-fingerprinted (I am not sure how fingerprints &quot;expire&quot; <br/>especially when they are recorded in digital format).  We have now paid the fee <br/>twice for the updating of both the I-600 and the fingerprints.  The costs for adoption <br/>are quite prohibitive already.  I am respectfully asking that the fees associated <br/>with the forms required for adoption not be increased as proposed in USCIS-2006-<br/>0044.  Thank you for your consideration in this important matter.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c09a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T16:45:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T16:25:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Lynn Platter", "trackingNbr": "8021c09a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2218/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2218/attachments"}}}}}
