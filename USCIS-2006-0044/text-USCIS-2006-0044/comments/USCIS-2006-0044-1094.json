However, we feel the proposed fee increase is <br/>unwarranted and will add undue fiscal burden for families. This is especially true <br/>since increased wait times for adoption result in many families having to file twice <br/>while they are in process for the same adoption. If any fee increase is approved it <br/>should be paired with increased value to the families such as an extension of the <br/>period of aproval i.e., up to 24 months and/or a greatly reduced fee if the family <br/>has to file twice for the same adoption due to an expired approval. This should be <br/>about children, families and value added services to US citizens, Thanks for your <br/>consideration. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020f234", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-09T18:36:32Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-08T01:03:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Suzanne Santarcangelo", "trackingNbr": "8020f234", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1094/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1094/attachments"}}}}}
