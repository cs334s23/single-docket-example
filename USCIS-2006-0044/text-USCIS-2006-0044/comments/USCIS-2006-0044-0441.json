We are currently in the process of adopting <br/>from China, we were approved throught the USCIS and our I-171H is due to expire <br/>in May, we will not receive our child before then.  We are spending almost $700 to <br/>renew whith the USCIS, $600 for our homestudy update, co-pays for Dr. <br/>physicals, tests ect.  I think it is unfair that I should have to pay all this AGAIN <br/>when I was alredy approved and the adoption hasn&#39;t taken place yet.<br/><br/>BUT:  to increase these already unjustified fees would just be cruel!  This won&#39;t <br/>effect me,not this time, but for my fellow adoptive parents to be, I will speak up.<br/>This money could be put to better use.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206f0d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:22:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T04:41:44Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Pamela M.
