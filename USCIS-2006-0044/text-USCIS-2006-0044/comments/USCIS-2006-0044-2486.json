Many of these families must rely on adoption as the sole means<br/>to having a family.  They are wonderful people willing to open their hearts and<br/>homes to children from foreign lands to provide a better and loving home to<br/>children in need.  The costs of adoption are already outrageous.  Many loving<br/>couples are already priced out of the possibility of affording them.  It is<br/>unconscionable that our government is adding to this incredible financial<br/>burden.  As a retired teacher I know that many families who rely on a teacher&#39;s<br/>salary are already strapped financially.  With increased fees you are increasing<br/>the possibility that these well educated, dedicated professionals who dedicated<br/>their lives to the children of our nation will no longer be able to have a<br/>family of their own.  Please reconsider your fee increases.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d95c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:17:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T04:49:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Kathleen Brickell", "trackingNbr": "8021d95c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2486/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2486/attachments"}}}}}
