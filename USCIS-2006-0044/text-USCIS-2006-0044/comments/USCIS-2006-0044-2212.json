I am writing to let you know that I strongly oppose the<br/>proposed increase in<br/>fees. The wait time to adopt is long and often the paperwork for the USCIS needs<br/>to be filed (and paid) 2-3x before an adoption is completed. Increasing the fees<br/>only adds insult to injury. I know this is a sweeping legislation for most USCIS<br/>documents but I would urge you to exempt adoptive paperwork from your fee increases.<br/><br/>Sincerely - <br/><br/>Heather Kaminski<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021bfa3", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T02:33:14Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-29T15:25:56Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Heather Kaminski", "trackingNbr": "8021bfa3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2212/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2212/attachments"}}}}}
