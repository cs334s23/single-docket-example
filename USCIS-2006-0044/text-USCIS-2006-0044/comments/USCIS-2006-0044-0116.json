This is <br/>especially true for those applying for naturalization.  In the past, CIS has proposed <br/>more modest fee increases to cover costs and improve customer service.  These <br/>increases are huge and, since they are proposed to be implemented &quot;all at once&quot; <br/>will make it much more difficult for immigrants and their families to avail <br/>themselves of benefits for which they may qualify.  I oppose the government&#39;s new <br/>fee schedule.  I believe there should be some evidence that the revenue <br/>generated by these fee increases will indeed improve customer service before the <br/>new fee schedule becomes law.
