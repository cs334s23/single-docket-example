I am in <br/>the process of adopting a child from China.  I sincerely ask that you take into <br/>consideration the following points before passing this increase:<br/>1) Many adoptive parents are now having to submit the I600A more than once <br/>during the adoption process - This is due to lengthening waiting times from the <br/>original submittal of the paperwork to the country of origin and the time of actual <br/>adoption.  This means adopting parents will have to pay this fee TWICE (since the <br/>document expires after 18 months).  This is a very large sum of money for many <br/>of us.<br/>2) Because of the 100% likelihood that we will have to file the I600A again, <br/>perhaps you can put a discounted fee in place for those of us who are filing a 2nd <br/>(or possibly 3rd) time for the same adoption.   This would be greatly appreciated.<br/>3) While I understand economics/inflation and how it affects the cost of doing <br/>business, the adoption-related fees proposed are exponentially higher!  I can <br/>comprehend a slightly higher &quot;market adjustment&quot; if fees have not been increased <br/>for many years, but USCIS has increased its fees regularly over the years.  I ask <br/>that you reconsider such a drastic increase.  <br/>4) The petitions and related fee increases that will directly impact us are: I600A, N-<br/>565 and N-600.  The 1600A fee is nearly 20% higher. The N-565 and N-600 both <br/>have proposed % increases of over 40%. <br/><br/>My husband and I budgeted for slightly more than what we expected to pay in <br/>fees, etc - but this is MUCH greater than we would have ever anticipated.<br/><br/>Thank you, in advance, for your consideration of these points.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480219e61", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-27T16:34:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T20:17:19Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80219e61", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1695/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1695/attachments"}}}}}
