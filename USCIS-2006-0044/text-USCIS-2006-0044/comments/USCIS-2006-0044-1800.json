Adoption is <br/>expensive enough already, and it is unconscionable to raise fees by up to 66% for <br/>adoption-related petitions, especially with many of us having to renew our I-<br/>600a/171H because they expired in 18 months before we are even referred a child. <br/>As a parent waiting to adopt and knowing I will very likely be renewing my I600a <br/>form next year prior to bringing home a daughter I ask you to not raise the prices, <br/>which just add to the total cost of bringing a child to his/her forever family.
