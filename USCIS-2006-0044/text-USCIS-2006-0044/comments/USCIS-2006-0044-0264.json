Johnston Retired Oklahoma OIC sent to IMMIGRANT&#39;S <br/>WEEKLY FROM ILW.COM<br/><br/>Dear Weekly Editor:<br/>I retired from the former INS in 2000 but I remember fees costing<br/>$10 for an immigrant petition and $50 for an application for<br/>citizenship.  Understandably the cost of doing business for the<br/>government has risen dramatically but I am sure not as a direct<br/>result of aliens attempting to gain lawful permanent status or<br/>citizenship.  I am not sure if it could be directly tied to more<br/>exhaustive record checks. It used to take no more than15 minutes<br/>to decide the fate of a family petition or an application for<br/>citizenship when face to face interviews were the norm.  Face to<br/>face interviews, on the average take approximately the same<br/>amount of time once all record checks are done yet the final<br/>decision takes months. So what is the underlying cause to this<br/>phenomenon?  Fees increased to offset the manpower needs,<br/>modernization, and background inquiries yet we continue to see<br/>the same results.  Adjudicators are usually required to process<br/>20-25 naturalization applications per shift.  If we multiply each<br/>by $400 the result is $8000 to 10,000 per day each officer.  The<br/>fee increase would generate approximately $12,000 to 15,000 per<br/>officer work day. If we calculate $50 per hour for each officer<br/>(and this is very high) for an eight hour day we arrive at $400<br/>per day.  So how many personnel are assisting in the flow of each<br/>application?  I do not believe there are enough people to justify<br/>such exorbitant fees even if CIS was so technologically advance<br/>that it would be in the 23rd century! Pay me $50 each, give me<br/>access to the system and I will do as many as you want and save<br/>our taxpayers and users a bundle.  Not only will applicants and<br/>taxpayers save but the time to process each petition or<br/>application would be dramatically reduced.<br/>Victor W.
