The adoption process is already a costly and <br/>lengthy one, and due to the short period of time these approvals are good for (15 <br/>months for fingerprints and 18 months for the I600A), we have had to reapply and <br/>spend double the initial cost already.  Now with this increase, we will also have to <br/>spend over $200 more to apply for the N600?!  For families that already are doing <br/>everything they can to pull the money together to adopt internationally, this is very <br/>discouraging.<br/><br/>If you are seriously considering increasing the fees, please consider lengthening <br/>the time these applications are valid before need to renew!  Without a lengthening <br/>of the approval periods, an increase in fees will only cost adoptive families more <br/>money for an already very expensive endeavor.<br/><br/>We respectfully voice our opposition to USCIS-2006-0044 and this increase in <br/>fees.  Please reconsider this decision.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Troy &amp; Christine Mathison<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c6f9", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2009-01-14T19:36:21Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T03:05:23Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Troy & Christine Mathison", "trackingNbr": "8021c6f9", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2263/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2263/attachments"}}}}}
