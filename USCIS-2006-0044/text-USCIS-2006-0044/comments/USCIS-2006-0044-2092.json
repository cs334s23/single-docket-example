The fees for issuing these applications is already at a steep level and <br/>in light of the paperwork for the I-600a having to be renewed since the I171H is <br/>only good for 18 months, prospective parents are having to pay this fee twice and <br/>in the future, possibly three times. None of us reached this decision to adopt <br/>lightly and the financial burden is a major consideration. Having our government <br/>raise these fees so steeply is appalling as it is not enough to keep us from <br/>proceeding with our plans but truly an added burden for americans who only desire <br/>to bring their child home. <br/>Thank you for your time.<br/>Maureen Mann<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b238", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T00:44:17Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T12:49:27Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Maureen C.
