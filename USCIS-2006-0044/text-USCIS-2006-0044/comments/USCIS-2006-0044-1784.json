Foreign adoptions <br/>dramatically cut the risk of a birth parent coming back for their child.  I even <br/>looked into adoption in the U.S. only to find that the wait is longer than what we <br/>are currently experiencing and if we went to a private adoption agency, it would be <br/>just as or more expensive than many foreign adoptions with the fear of a birth <br/>parent changing their mind at any time.  Increasing fees would hurt many people <br/>that have budgeted for their adoption.  I urge you not to raise fees especially when <br/>we have to pay for updates which correlate to wait time.  Please remember that <br/>there are so many children needing and wanting homes all over the world and that <br/>you can help or hinder that process.  I pray you help by not raising fees.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/>Mrs. Tiffany Soignoli<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a181", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T16:23:47Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-28T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T02:23:33Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Tiffany L.
