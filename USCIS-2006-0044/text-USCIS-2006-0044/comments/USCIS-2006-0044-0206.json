My husband has been trying to get <br/>his green card for the last year and 8 months and all the agency will tell us is that <br/>his case is in &quot;processing&quot;. Really? It has been in processing for that long? You <br/>see, USCIS doesn&#39;t want to change his status so we can keep paying the fees to <br/>extend his work visa every year and driving 2 hours out of our way for 1(yes one) <br/>fingerprint. USCIS does not care about the people they claim they are working to <br/>help. Seriously, have you ever gotten a nice person on the phone when you have <br/>called the 800 number to ask a simple question? I haven&#39;t, and everyone that I <br/>have talked to can barely speak English! I bet they got their papers fast. My point <br/>is, is increasing the fees really going to help, especially if you have been waiting <br/>for so long anyway? And have had to deal with people who are extremely rude, <br/>inconsiderate and it&#39;s like an act of congress to get the agency to send you a <br/>response in the mail. (my husband and I still have not heard from them and it has <br/>been over 3 months) Can the agency really guarantee that we will have faster turn-<br/>around times, better customer service and fewer backlogs? I doubt it. People think <br/>about it, the government is trying to issue an additional 40,000 H1B visas. Who do <br/>you think is going to process all these applications? The USCIS of course! In <br/>reality, we are going to be paying higher fees so they can process an additional <br/>40,000 visas. That means anyone in the system right now is going to just sit there <br/>even longer.
