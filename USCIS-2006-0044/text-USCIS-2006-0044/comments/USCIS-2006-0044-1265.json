Isn&#39;t it possible to rethink this decision.  With <br/>service times being dreadful at USCIS, and the fact that you can&#39;t even accurately <br/>track status of applications, I believe there should be major improvement in service <br/>before you start charging people more money.  You should look into a <br/>Congressional appropriation for accomplishing this.  People who use this service <br/>are already paying taxes on incomes, property and sales.  If they put into the pot, <br/>they should be able to take some out now and again.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480212e56", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T16:44:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-12T16:51:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By James A.
