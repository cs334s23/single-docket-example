As an adoptive mother whose youngest <br/>child came from Russia 11 years ago, I know how wonderful adoption overseas <br/>can be for American couples. As a Trade Tower widow, I know what my life would <br/>be like without my children. It is unconscionable for our governement to increase <br/>hardship on these families. Some of these couples will have already gone through <br/>many financially draining years of paying for infertility treatments. This forces <br/>some couples to  borrow the money to attempt their overseas adoption. Adoption <br/>is one of the few life choices which is positive for many people. It is good for the <br/>birthparents who cannot raise the child, it is good for the infertile couple desperate <br/>for a child. It is wonderful for the child who would have otherwise grown up without <br/>a family. In many foreign lands, it is a bleak future for childrn like these. It is my <br/>hope that the US will not become an impediment for foreign adoption. There are so <br/>many other ways to balance our budget than on the backs of people like this. <br/>Sincerely, Leslie Dimmling<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021dd8e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:07:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T18:43:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Leslie Dimmling", "trackingNbr": "8021dd8e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2561/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2561/attachments"}}}}}
