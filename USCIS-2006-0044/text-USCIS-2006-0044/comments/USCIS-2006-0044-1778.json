The documents indicated are related to international adoption, an already <br/>lengthy and expensive undertaking. An increase in these already expensive fees <br/>could potentialy creat an even greater hardship for those who desire to adopt a <br/>child from overseas. Since the time frame from application to actual adoption of <br/>the child is currently longer than the expiration on most of these documents, <br/>amny fees already have to be paid twice by adoptive parents. When adopting our <br/>daughter from China we had to pay several fees twice because the documents <br/>expired prior to travel.It is already infuriating enough that the fingerprint time frame <br/>expires and the whole process needs to be completed a second time in many <br/>cases instead of a more cost effective extension of the time frame.<br/>Please reconsider raising these fees.<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a131", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:09:16Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-27T01:38:03Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Dawn A.
