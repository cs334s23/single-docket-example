And not just by a little bit, but <br/>by an amount that far surpasses the rate of inflation.  Many of these documents <br/>(and fingerprinting) are time sensitive which causes families to reapply in a large <br/>majority of instances.  Families are being punished for the timelines of other <br/>countries - over which none of us have any control.<br/><br/>I think the US Government needs to seriously reconsider raising those fees, <br/>especially by such an absurb amount, for adoptive families.  Or extend the <br/>expiration date to a time frame that better matches what is going on with the <br/>timelines in other countries for processing dossiers so families only have to file <br/>once.  <br/><br/>Building healthy, loving families ought to be the priority - not more money for <br/>someone&#39;s pocket!<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d90c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T15:17:00Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T03:48:41Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sue Boyd", "trackingNbr": "8021d90c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2482/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2482/attachments"}}}}}
