International adoption is a wonderful way<br/>to build a family, but for my government to increase fees by an average of 66%<br/>is appalling.  Each time you increase these fees it may mean that a child who<br/>desperately needs a family is unable to come home.  I would ask you for the sake<br/>of the children please do not increase these fees!!<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/>Sarah <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b55c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:15:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T18:17:53Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Sarah Escalera", "trackingNbr": "8021b55c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1997/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1997/attachments"}}}}}
