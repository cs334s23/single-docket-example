I am currently waiting to adopt a baby from <br/>China.  We started this process in Dec. 2005.  We saved and scrimped and saved <br/>some more.  Now we have learned that our savings have to be stretched even <br/>further.  We need to re apply to get a new 171H as our old one will expire before <br/>we have a chance to adopt.  Unfortunately, if the wait continues to and the pace of <br/>referrals continue as such we are seeing these past few months, we may have to <br/>apply a third time for a new 171H.  In order to apply each time, we are required to <br/>update our home study report.  This also involves more fees, time taken off from <br/>work and additional appointments and time.  I respectfully request that you <br/>consider not raising the fees for the fingerprinting and filing of the 1600A.  It would <br/>be one less hurdle for many adopting parents to worry about.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Jennifer Hamilton<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480206b9f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T00:46:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-15T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T00:02:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Jennifer Hamilton", "trackingNbr": "80206b9f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0415/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0415/attachments"}}}}}
