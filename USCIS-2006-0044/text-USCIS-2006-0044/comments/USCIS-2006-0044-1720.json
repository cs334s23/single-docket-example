The US is a melting pot of immigrants...what better way to help <br/>abolish terrorism in foreign 3rd world countries than to bring these children into <br/>american homes where parents will love and protect them...raising them to be <br/>good citizens and advocates of what the US stands for. The benefit that the US <br/>derives from the international adoption process far outweighs the increase in fees. <br/>However, the potential parents and children must suffer when there is an increase <br/>in fees.
