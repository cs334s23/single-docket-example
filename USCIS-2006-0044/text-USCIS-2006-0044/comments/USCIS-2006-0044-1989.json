I can understand that costs do <br/>increase over time, to be able to maintain a level of service. However this increase <br/>is quite considerable. <br/><br/>The financial burden on adoptive parents has already been acknowledged by the <br/>adoption tax credit. It seems illogical to help families be able to afford the <br/>incredible expense of building a family and then punish them in another area by <br/>drastically raising fees. Adoption is the only choice for many families who want to <br/>have children. <br/><br/>The fact is, there is a financial burden when a family adopts. Help <br/>our family, and so many others like us, by truly examining this proposal and <br/>making an effort to keep the filing fees affordable. If there needs to be an increase <br/>in fees to cover the costs let it be a reasonable amount. Does 66% sounds <br/>reasonable?<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b523", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T16:12:05Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T17:49:45Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Chris Cannon", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Karla Stirling", "trackingNbr": "8021b523", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1989/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1989/attachments"}}}}}
