This proposed increase will in effect prejudice <br/>those potential petitioners who most need the system to help them integrate with <br/>the U.S. Society: that is, they simply will not be able to afford it. This will increase <br/>the number of undocumented and possibly compel individuals to try to circumvent <br/>the system itself because they have no other choice. Those that try to meet these <br/>fees will more than likely be forced to abandon any idea of seaking legal help due <br/>to the additional cost thereby making mistakes and filing inadequate petitions etc. <br/>thereby further clogging the system&#39;s arteries. In my opinion such a request lacks <br/>the common sense God gave a child.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9d75", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-02T18:18:22Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T14:09:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Mark J.
