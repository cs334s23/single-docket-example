I feel that adoption is way <br/>too expensive as it is for people who cannot have children or those wanting to add to <br/>their families.  Raising the fees for adoption-related petitions makes it even HARDER <br/>on us financially to adopt a child who needs a loving and safe home.  It&#39;s not about the <br/>money....it&#39;s about the children.  It should ONLY be about the children and we should <br/>have their best interests at heart and not make it difficult for us by emptying our bank <br/>accounts before we get them home.  We have to support them financially.  Doesn&#39;t <br/>anyone think of that before raising fees?  Adoption is way too expensive and to raise <br/>any of the HUGE fees we are facing will be more stressful and for most people a huge <br/>struggle.    I strongly object to raising the fees by up to 66% for adoption-related <br/>petitions!   We&#39;re trying to help the children so why would fees be raised to slow down <br/>the process and the gift of helping children?
