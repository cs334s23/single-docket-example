We have <br/>already <br/>experienced one fee increase by the Chinese government, now another by our <br/>own government?  Can&#39;t governments do something to help people who are trying <br/>to adopt instead of increasing the roadblocks!  Shouldn;t it be about the children?  <br/>The USCIS has already caused us significant delays and increased costs <br/>because they did not ask for the correct documents when we applied.  Please <br/>reconsider this proposal!
