Due to <br/>many events, I will already need to file the necessary documents twice in order <br/>to &#39;stay active&#39; because of the inordinate amount of time that referrals have <br/>increased in the past several months.  These fees are outrageously expensive and <br/>it would be greatly appreciated if you would take into consideration people who <br/>have to file over and over simply due to extended wait times.<br/>Thank you,<br/>Valerie <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021de2b", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T20:07:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-31T20:27:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Valerie Whiteside", "trackingNbr": "8021de2b", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2573/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2573/attachments"}}}}}
