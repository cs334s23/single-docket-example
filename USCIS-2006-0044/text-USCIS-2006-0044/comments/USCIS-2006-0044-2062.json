We are concerned <br/>about your proposal to raise fees regarding international adoption. We feel the <br/>high costs of adoption are already quite prohibitive. An increase in these already <br/>large fees would be a burdon to those who seek to assist the orphan. While we <br/>are more than willing to make necessary sacrifices, there are likely other areas <br/>you could look at to improve your budget, such as looking at reducing your costs. <br/>For example, we sent our packet in for fingerprinting, and it was returned IN FULL <br/>because we accidentally sent $1 too much for the fee. Would it not have been <br/>more cost effective to send us a dollar and proceed with our application-or keep <br/>the dollar for yourself (we wouldn&#39;t of cared)?  We voice our concern not just for <br/>ourselves (our fee has already been paid), but for the other parents seeking <br/>international adoption and for the orphans.
