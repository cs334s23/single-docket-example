It is already very expensive for<br/>parents to adopt internationally and raising the fee would only make it more<br/>difficult for middle income families to adopt.  Just as we, as adoptive parents,<br/>feel that our family would not be complete without international adoption, there<br/>are children in the world who are not complete without a family.  Raising the<br/>fee would make it harder for these children and parents to become a family. <br/>Please take my comments into account when making this decision.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Stacie Dixon<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c6a8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:01:02Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T02:22:30Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Stacie Dixon", "trackingNbr": "8021c6a8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2260/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2260/attachments"}}}}}
