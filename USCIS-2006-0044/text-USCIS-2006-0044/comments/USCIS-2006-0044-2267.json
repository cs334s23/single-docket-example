The first in Jan., 1997, 2nd July 2000,<br/>the 3rd Sept of 2006.  The fees have gone up considerably since our first<br/>adoption.  I guess I would not mind the fee increases so much if the service<br/>were to improve as was promised but that is just not the case.  Adoption is<br/>already an extremely expensive endeavor.  Families are at the mercy of all of<br/>the systems whose hoops they have to jump through to become parents.  These are<br/>law abiding, tax paying, citizens who are getting taken advantage of at a time<br/>when our country should be cutting them some breaks not BREAKING them!  Our<br/>three adoptions cost in the neighborhood of 20,000.00 each.  We are not rich, we<br/>just wanted to parent children who needed someone to love, feed and shelter<br/>them.  We have no regrets for having adopted as we do love our children very<br/>much.  The only regret I do have is that my country feels the need to continue<br/>raising the fees for immigration services but continues to lower the quality of<br/>service! <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c7f5", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:01:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T05:41:48Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Patricia Coleman", "trackingNbr": "8021c7f5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2267/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2267/attachments"}}}}}
