These <br/>fees directly affect people who are adopting a child or children and with the <br/>proposed price increase, which is substantial, could make a difference in <br/>someone?s decision to adopt. Every child needs a family that loves them and <br/>cares about them. This should be the priority, not how much money we can make <br/>from adopting parents.<br/><br/>We are in the process of adopting and our I-171H, which is only good for 18 <br/>months, has expired, because the process has slowed down. We now have to re-<br/>file our I-600/600A, which means we have to pay again for our I-171H. This is <br/>another unjust fee that we have to pay. I think that you should leave the fees as <br/>they are and consider a change to the re-filing fee, as this is a matter of extending <br/>the original form for more than 18 months. It should not cost the same.<br/><br/>Brad<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b731", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:27:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T21:41:38Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Brad", "trackingNbr": "8021b731", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2036/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2036/attachments"}}}}}
