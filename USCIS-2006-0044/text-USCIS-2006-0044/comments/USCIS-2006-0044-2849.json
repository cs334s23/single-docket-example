We believe most families attempting to adopt a child <br/>are already under huge pressure to bring their children home.  We believe the <br/>child&#39;s country should make every attempt to close the adoption before the <br/>adopting family would have to pay the entire fee again. These families are probably <br/>already receiving substantial assistance from family members, churches, <br/>fundraisers, and all other ways to generate income to adopt. Lets not even talk <br/>about the loans some families take on to adopt a child.  These agencies and <br/>adopting countries might think about increasing staff to complete dossiers more <br/>efficiently.  This should not be a source of anxiety for families attempting to bring <br/>their children home.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021f06a", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:05:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T21:12:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Thomas and Michelle Gordon", "trackingNbr": "8021f06a", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2849/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2849/attachments"}}}}}
