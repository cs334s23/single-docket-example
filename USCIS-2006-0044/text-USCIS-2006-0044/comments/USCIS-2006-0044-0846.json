As I am sure you have heard, adoption from China, the largest international <br/>adoption program here in the U.S., has extended the normal wait time for thousands of waiting <br/>adoptive families. As a result,  renewal of the I-600A is necessary. This enormously large <br/>population of adoptive families has repeatedly petitioned the USCIS &amp; the US Government to <br/>either extend the length of validity time of the 171H or to lower the fees associated with renewing <br/>it.<br/><br/>I am very angry to hear that you not only do not care about the financial burden this places on <br/>people trying to build a family but you are considering increasing that burden. Shame, shame, <br/>shame, on you for not listening to us and for seemingly not caring.<br/><br/>I am hoping my voice is heard here against your proposed fee increases.<br/><br/>Shannon Yates<br/>waiting parent for a daughter from China<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207714", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-23T19:32:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-23T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T14:13:42Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Shannon Yates", "trackingNbr": "80207714", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0846/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0846/attachments"}}}}}
