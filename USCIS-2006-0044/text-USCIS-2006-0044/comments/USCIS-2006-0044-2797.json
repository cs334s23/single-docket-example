Today the exact same form <br/>costs a prospective adoptive parent $545.  Biometric fingerprinting, which began in <br/>1998, has risen in cost from $25 to $75 per applicant.  For a two-parent family <br/>adopting a single child, the USCIS process new costs $695.   Because of the <br/>instability inherent in international adoption, many families find that their USCIS <br/>approval expires prior to their invitation to travel to their prospective child?s birth <br/>country.  As a result, many families (especially those adopting from China, <br/>Russia, and Guatemala) find themselves repeating the entire immigration <br/>application two or three times.  This can increase the cost of an adoption by <br/>thousands of dollars ? money many of us simply do not have. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing <br/>applications and with its customer service.  Processing throughout the regional <br/>offices is erratic ? some I-600A applications take months to process, while <br/>individuals in other districts received approval of the exact same form within ten <br/>days.  The refusal of officials to give adoptive parents priority results in children <br/>languishing in orphanages or foster care overseas for months and months at a <br/>time.  Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers (I-140) <br/>and employment authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 and 1.97 months, <br/>respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned child (3.39 months).   There is <br/>no explanation for why USCIS finds it possible to process the projected 859,543 I-<br/>765 and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260 I-600/600A applicants.  <br/>Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given greater scrutiny than <br/>adult foreign workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are met with deaf <br/>ears and directed to a ?status? website which is not updated.  As a result of <br/>USCIS? refusal to prioritize orphan petitions, thousands of children suffer <br/>needlessly.  There has been no move by USCIS to assist prospective adoptive <br/>parents whose documents expire while they wait for their child?s home country to <br/>grant them approval to travel.  These parents are forced to reapply with USCIS, <br/>repaying the same fees two and sometimes three additional times, each time <br/>subjecting themselves to the same long and uncertain wait for immigration <br/>approval.  If USCIS would simply extend the expiration deadline for the I-171H from <br/>eighteen months to three years, it would significantly reduce its workload without <br/>having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>In this request for an increase in fees, USCIS is not asking for what it needs, it is <br/>asking for what it wants.  It claims that this fee increase ?is designed to provide for <br/>an adequate and sustainable level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and <br/>processes designed to improve the USCIS? ability to administer the nation?s <br/>immigration laws.?  The Bureau justifies these increases by asserting that ?this fee <br/>rule would provide the necessary resources to maintain these processing time <br/>standards and fund further improvements to USCIS business operations to <br/>continue to reduce processing times while ensuring the appropriate level of <br/>security.?<br/><br/>There are very few infants or children infiltrating Al-Qaeda.  The idea that adoptive <br/>parents are a threat to national security is laughable.  While we agree with the <br/>aims of the Department of Homeland Security, the additional levels of scrutiny on <br/>orphaned children and their prospective parents is absurd.  <br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud, improving <br/>service, changing benefit applications from paper to electronic means in order to <br/>streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to bear the burden of these goals <br/>is unconscionable.  Worse still, many of USCIS? stated aims do not directly <br/>benefit those seeking to immigrate.  <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and are <br/>mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings to bring home a child.  <br/>Increasing the burden on us is not simply unfair, it is detrimental to the lives of <br/>waiting children.  We urge rejection of the current proposal and a new requirement <br/>that USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first priority to I-<br/>600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork required for orphan petitions, <br/>and extend the expiration of the I-171H from eighteen months to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Allison L.
