As a <br/>result they have instituted extensive fees, some legitimate and some often nothing more than graft.  <br/>The result is fewer adoptions.  Why increase fees and reduce the incentive to find homes for <br/>children who need them?  Instead of putting barriers in the way of adoptions, we should be finding <br/>ways to facilitate adoptions.  We should lead the way be keeping adoption costs to a minimum.  <br/><br/>Please do not raise the fees for adoptions.  If you must raise fees to help pay for costs, please be <br/>as frugal as possible.  My sense is that a 66% increase in fees means that this is much more than <br/>a &quot;cost of living&quot; increase.  I understand that the current political climate is pay as you go, but <br/>some services such as adoptions should be subsidized as much as possible.  <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021b75d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-29T19:27:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-29T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-28T22:07:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Shawn P.
