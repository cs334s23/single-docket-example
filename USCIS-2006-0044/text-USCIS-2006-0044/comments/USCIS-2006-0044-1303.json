So the actual time the applicant need <br/>to benefit from the other two forms is quite short. Therefore the proposal&#39;s <br/>estimation on the use of EAD and Advance Parole is probably too high.<br/><br/>Also, this proposal is based on the assumption that USCIS will work under the <br/>pressure of economic penalty if they do not process application prompt. We know <br/>for a government agent, that&#39;s never the case. Efficiency is often sacrificed in <br/>name of accuracy. An agent could intentionally delay the processing of some <br/>forms to gain financial advantages; but the most effective way to correct that, as <br/>what USCIS is facing now, is through executive dealines and regulations. I support <br/>adequate financing to get the job done properly, however, these lump-sump kind of <br/>plans, even they were correctly estimated, very often miss their target.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802161b7", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-19T16:25:01Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-19T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-19T15:56:54Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "802161b7", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1303/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1303/attachments"}}}}}
