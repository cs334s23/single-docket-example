I believe the validity time should be increased to 18 months or 2 years.  <br/>(Simply re-run the fingerprints already taken to verify the parents? legal history.) <br/>The rate increase makes the situation even more difficult for adopting parents.  <br/>Not only are we having to re-do the paperwork, and take time off of work to get re-<br/>fingerprinted, but now we may be required to pay even more then the original rate.  <br/><br/>Please, please, take into consideration the financial situation of adopting parents. <br/>We greatly desire to take a child with no family into our home and raise the child <br/>as our own treasured son or daughter.  Please do not make this process even <br/>more difficult for us.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your consideration.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jennifer L.
