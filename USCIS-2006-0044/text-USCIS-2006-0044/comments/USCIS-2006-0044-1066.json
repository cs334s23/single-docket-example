My husband and I are <br/>in the process of adopting a child from an orphanage overseas.  We have been <br/>waiting for the adoption to be final for nearly two years.  Thus, our USCIS will soon <br/>expire and we will have to re-file and repay the full amount a second time.  <br/>Adoption fees are expensive enough, it is unreasonable to have to pay a fee twice <br/>when the bureacracy is already causing our original one to expire with delays.  <br/>We would adopt in the U.S., however, there are no orphanages here and we want <br/>to make sure we are adopting a child with true needs who would not have the <br/>opportunity of a good quality life otherwise.  I understand that our country&#39;s <br/>growing population is a concern.  But we shouldn&#39;t penalize immigrating future <br/>citizens with increased fees.  We should focus on birth control here, and impose <br/>fees onto natural citizens who bring more than five children into the world period!  <br/>Over-reproducing is something we should have control over; not people who are <br/>already born and simply want to leave everything they&#39;ve known behind and come <br/>to our country to reunite with family, be adopted, or hope for a better life with more <br/>education and less crime and poverty.  People are already sacrificing a lot <br/>financially to bring an orphaned child to the U.S. or an elderly parent or student <br/>who will become a permanent productive contributing member of our society.  <br/>Let&#39;s find other avenues for revenue, that do not directly affect the lives of such <br/>people who already have enough obstacles to immigrate.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020d894", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-05T15:53:21Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-04T18:27:51Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Melanie", "trackingNbr": "8020d894", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1066/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1066/attachments"}}}}}
