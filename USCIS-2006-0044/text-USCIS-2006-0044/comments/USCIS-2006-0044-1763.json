It <br/>appears that this is an arbitrary increase, and possibly completely unnecessary. <br/>The United States prodes itself on being a goodwill ambassador to all nations. We <br/>continue and perhaps folster that reputation via international adoptions. Many birth <br/>parents in other countries dream of allowing their children to live, grow, and be <br/>educated in the United States. They know that there are opportunities and <br/>freedoms here that they cannot gurantee their children in their countries of origin. <br/>Increasing these fees will only make it more difficult for loving American families to <br/>extend the hand of goodwill towards these countries via adoption. <br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021a08e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-28T01:04:12Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-27T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-26T23:59:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "Churck Schumer", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Diane Kampf", "trackingNbr": "8021a08e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1763/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1763/attachments"}}}}}
