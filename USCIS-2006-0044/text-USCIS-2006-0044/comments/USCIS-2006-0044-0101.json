I mean, come on. We aren&#39;t all made of money! Most of us are <br/>hardworking American people, but we aren&#39;t all (or even mostly!) rich! My husband <br/>of 2 years came over (from England) on a finance visa in 2005. We have already <br/>adjusted his status, but we will have to remove conditions later this year and then <br/>he will want to become a dual citizen at some point down the road. We had to use <br/>wedding money for AOS fees (combined with EAD, etc etc!) and that was 700.00 <br/>then! I have no idea how we would have paid a fee like you&#39;re talking about now. <br/>We work, but we just make ends meet most of the time. It&#39;s very easy to sit up <br/>there on your high horses when you don&#39;t have to struggle to pay your bills. I could <br/>care less if it cuts the stupid process by two months.....NO WAY. A fee increase <br/>this large is uttely *ridiculous*. <br/><br/>M.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064801f9b4f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2008-04-03T17:53:45Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-02T09:38:15Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Michelle (Surname Unknown)", "trackingNbr": "801f9b4f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0101/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0101/attachments"}}}}}
