Firstly, it <br/>is way above any reasonable inflation rates.  In most services in life, an increase <br/>of fees can be expected but normally around the current inflation rates, as does <br/>our incomes.  If USCIS need extra money to improve the service, it should be <br/>sought from other funding sources other than putting more responsibilities on the <br/>people who are struggling with the already high costs of immigration.<br/><br/>I?ll give an example of my situation, I currently work on H1-B visa which means <br/>that my spouse is not allowed to work, so I am the sole supporter of my family of <br/>4.  No trying to get a GC .. I have to come up with so many costs... the lawyer fee <br/>alone is around $6000 plus all the extra application and medical costs.<br/><br/>No imagine how much this new fee increase would do to me ?... the increase for <br/>I-485 from $325 to $905 would mean a huge burden for me.  The cost for the GC?s <br/>would be $3620 ? that is an increase of $2320 .. how easy would that be for me <br/>and my family?<br/><br/>Please re-consider your proposal... <br/><br/>Thank you for listening...<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef76", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:25:12Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8021ef76", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2823/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2823/attachments"}}}}}
