The international adoption process is very high for these <br/>exemplary neighbors. Now it appears they may be faced with proposed increases of <br/>about $600 for I-600A/1-600 and about $400 for N-600, and the Certificate of <br/>Citizenship for IR-4 children. We feel that adopting a baby is different from foreigners <br/>applying for citizenship, especially in these times of illegal immigration. At least  babies <br/>do not present time and money consuming investigations into political backgrounds, <br/>and they&#39;ll grow up with taxpaying parents who are already on record as good citizens. <br/>For these reasons we appeal to you for exempting the adoption of babies from the <br/>above mentioned fee increases.<br/>Thank you for your consideration.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sincerely, Cornelis and Norma Janse-Kok<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064802054e8", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-14T18:45:53Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-14T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-13T23:42:26Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cornelis C.
