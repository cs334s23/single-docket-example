These children <br/>need loving homes. So I have to question the idea of raising the fees. It only <br/>makes is hard for these soon to be parents to complete thier famlies. They need <br/>to be buying furniture and clothes for their little ones, not spending it on your over <br/>priced fees. Please take in to consideration what these candidates already have <br/>to go through to get the forms they need to complete this journey. Its absolutely <br/>absurd to raise the fees one-hundred dollar or more for a peice of paper that costs <br/>a penny.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d37c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:16:43Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T20:29:07Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Denise Solomon", "trackingNbr": "8021d37c", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2427/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2427/attachments"}}}}}
