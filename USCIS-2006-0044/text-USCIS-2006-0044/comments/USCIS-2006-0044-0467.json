While <br/>waiting for the referral for our second adopted child, we already will be required to <br/>go through this process twice--not because of the requirements of the country <br/>from which we are adopting, but because of the time line for the US policies <br/>regarding the expiration of these documents.  The process already is incredibly <br/>cumbersome and inconvenient, depending on where one lives, and I find myself <br/>asking what we, the US citizens and tax payers, could possibley gain by <br/>increased fees for this process . After sitting for 2 hours each time at the local <br/>BCIS office -2 hours away from our home-with a scheduled appointment time that <br/>has never been met on the 3 different occasions we have had to go there (soon to <br/>be 4), I&#39;m highly skeptical that a higher fee would help the inefficient process. We <br/>are not opposed to paying a fee, but we also lose an entire work day each time <br/>we must go through this process. Instead of feeling good about our government&#39;s <br/>efforts to enforce immigration laws, we have left feeling apalled about the <br/>ineffiencies and wondering how this process has made anyone any safer.<br/>If you must increase your fees, then please, please consider the extension of the <br/>expiration time line for these special circumstances.  <br/>Thank you.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480207a26", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-02-16T16:58:26Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-02-16T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-02-15T16:41:40Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "80207a26", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0467/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-0467/attachments"}}}}}
