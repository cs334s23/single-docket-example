By increasing the fees you will make United States citizenship available <br/>only to the wealthy and to those who are single, without multiple families <br/>members requiring fees..  <br/><br/>The United States of America was founded and established by immigrants.  All of <br/>our families immigrated, either centuries or years ago.  If our families had been <br/>required to pass the number of requirements now in place and to pay the fees <br/>proposed, how many of them could have even considered citizenship?<br/><br/>It is important that we keep this country the Great Democracy, a society that is <br/>open to all.  Do not increase the required fees to the point that money keeps <br/>people from seeking citizenship.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006480213140", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-13T15:52:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-13T02:11:34Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": "David Price", "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Cynthia L.
