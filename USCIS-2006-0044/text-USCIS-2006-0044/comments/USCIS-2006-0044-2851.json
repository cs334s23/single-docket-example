I am especially interested in those in the area of<br/>international adoption. My husband and I are in the midst of the adoption<br/>process, and are finding that is very costly. In fact, many families choose not<br/>to adopt strictly because of the prohibitive costs. There are many orphans<br/>around the world that need loving families. Please do your part in choosing to<br/>NOT increase these filing fees, and keep the costs for international adoption as<br/>low as possible.
