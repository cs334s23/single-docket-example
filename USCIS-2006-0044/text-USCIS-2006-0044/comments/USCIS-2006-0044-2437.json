Many <br/>prospective adopters have to file twice because the approval is only good for 18 <br/>months.  With adoptions taking longer and longer, most have to file again as they <br/>are not permitted to renew their filing.  They must pay the full price again.  My <br/>husband and I adopted our daughter 12 years ago, so we would not be affected by <br/>this proposed fee increase, but other families who want to adopt might not be able <br/>to because of the increasingly high expenses.  Thank you.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021d718", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-02T14:17:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-02T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T21:43:24Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Paula Grande", "trackingNbr": "8021d718", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2437/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2437/attachments"}}}}}
