As an adoptive <br/>mom to two young children, I can attest to the fact that it is an expensive thing to <br/>adopt internationally.  To provide children with a caring and loving family they <br/>might otherwise not have does come with a price tag and often a very high one.  I <br/>would ask that these increases in rates be reconsidered, so that the door remains <br/>open to families wishing to adopt internationally.  There are many special needs <br/>children whom without the prospect of being adopted internationally might have no <br/>chance for a decent life.  Many times those willing to adopt special needs children <br/>have a heart of gold, but money is just sooo tight that they find funding the <br/>adoption difficult to nearly impossible.  The proposed increases just make it even <br/>more difficult to find the funding for adoption to those who would open their hearts <br/>to bringing children home who might not otherwise have a home at all.<br/>Please reconsider the increase.<br/>Thankyou for your time,<br/>Carol Dymek<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021ef8f", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-04-04T01:04:40Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-04-03T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-04-02T19:33:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Carol Dymek", "trackingNbr": "8021ef8f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2827/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2827/attachments"}}}}}
