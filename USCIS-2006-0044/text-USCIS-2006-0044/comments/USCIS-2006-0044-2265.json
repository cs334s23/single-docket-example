Today the same form costs<br/>a prospective adoptive parent $545, an increase of more than 700%.  Biometric<br/>fingerprinting, which began in 1998, has risen in cost almost 3-fold, from $25<br/>to $70 per applicant.  For a two-parent family adopting a single child, the<br/>USCIS process costs in excess of $685.   Because of the changing timeframes<br/>attendant with international adoption, many families find that their USCIS<br/>approval, which is required prior to submission of a complete dossier to the<br/>birth country, expires prior to their invitation to travel to their prospective<br/>child?s birth country.  As a result, many families (especially those adopting<br/>from Russia, China and Guatemala) find themselves repeating the entire<br/>immigration application multiple times.  This can increase the cost of an<br/>adoption by thousands of dollars ? money many of us simply do not have. <br/><br/>The department admits that it has a dismal track record in processing<br/>applications and with its customer service.  Processing time in the regional<br/>offices is inconsistent; some I-600A applications take months to be processed,<br/>while individuals in other districts receive approval of the same form within<br/>ten days.  Most egregious is that the processing time for immigrant workers<br/>(I-140) and employment authorization (I-765) are less (average of 3.31 and 1.97<br/>months, respectively) than that to bring home an orphaned child (3.39 months). <br/> There is no explanation for why USCIS finds it possible to process the<br/>projected 859,543 I-765 and 129,743 I-140 applicants faster than the 29,260<br/>I-600/600A applicants.  Why are children seeking to immigrate to the U.S. given<br/>greater scrutiny than adult foreign workers?<br/><br/>Adoptive parents attempting to learn the status of their petition are met with<br/>indifference and directed to a ?status? website which is not updated.  As a<br/>result of USCIS? refusal to prioritize orphan petitions, thousands of children<br/>suffer needlessly.  There has been no move by USCIS to assist prospective<br/>adoptive parents whose documents ?expire? while they wait for their child?s home<br/>country to grant them approval to travel.  If USCIS would simply extend the<br/>?expiration? deadline for the I-171H from eighteen months to three years, it<br/>would significantly reduce its workload without having to increase its fees.<br/><br/>USCIS claims that this fee increase ?is designed to provide for an adequate and<br/>sustainable level of investment in staff, in infrastructure, and processes<br/>designed to improve the USCIS? ability to administer the nation?s immigration<br/>laws.?  The Bureau justifies these increases by asserting that ?this fee rule<br/>would provide the necessary resources to maintain these processing time<br/>standards and fund further improvements to USCIS business operations to continue<br/>to reduce processing times while ensuring the appropriate level of security.?<br/><br/>There are very few infants infiltrating Al-Qaeda.  The idea that adoptive<br/>parents are a threat to national security is laughable.  While we agree with the<br/>aims of the Department of Homeland Security, the additional levels of scrutiny<br/>on orphaned children and their prospective parents is absurd.<br/><br/>While the aims of the department are laudable (reducing identity fraud,<br/>improving service, changing benefit applications from paper to electronic means<br/>in order to streamline the process) forcing adoptive parents to bear the burden<br/>of these goals is unconscionable.  Worse still, many of USCIS? stated aims do<br/>not directly benefit those seeking to immigrate. <br/><br/>Many adoptive families have been through years of infertility and loss, and are<br/>mortgaging our homes and cleaning out our life savings to bring home a child. <br/>Increasing the burden on us is not simply unfair, it is detrimental to the lives<br/>of waiting children.  We urge rejection of the current proposal and a new<br/>requirement that USCIS reduce the fee burden on adoptive families, give first<br/>priority to I-600/600A applications, consolidate the paperwork required for<br/>orphan petitions, and extend the ?expiration? of the I-171H from eighteen months<br/>to three years.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Ann Marie Wolfe<br/><br/>Comment on FR Doc # E7-01631", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648021c743", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-30T17:01:09Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-30T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-30T03:47:47Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted by Ann Marie Wolfe", "trackingNbr": "8021c743", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2265/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-2265/attachments"}}}}}
