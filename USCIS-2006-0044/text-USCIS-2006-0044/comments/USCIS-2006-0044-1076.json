If IRS can handle millions of tax returns <br/>efficiently and timely every year, why can not USCIS do the same with even lesser <br/>number of immigration petitions? President Bush must stop political appointments <br/>at USCIS helm and choose a competent administrator to run it in a more <br/>streamlined, efficient manner. <br/><br/>Why should I pay for the lapse of processing by DOL (backlog elimination centers, <br/>what a poor idea) and other agencies? Immigrants money is wasted on outside <br/>contractors and bloated employee expenses. Let us trim that fat first. Let us focus <br/>on some real performance measurements at USCIS instead of gimmicks which <br/>show reduced backlog.  <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": null, "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "USCIS-2006-0044", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648020dc6e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2007-03-05T21:05:13Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "", "pageCount": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2007-03-05T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2007-03-05T18:09:55Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": null, "title": "Comment Submitted By Anonymous", "trackingNbr": "8020dc6e", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1076/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/USCIS-2006-0044-1076/attachments"}}}}}
